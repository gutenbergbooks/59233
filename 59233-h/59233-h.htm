<p class='c006'><span class='sc'>Since</span> the year 1895, when Professor Flinders
Petrie’s book on <i>Historical Scarabs</i> became “out
of print,” the want of a comprehensive work on
these interesting little Egyptian antiquities has been
much felt. Two volumes on Egyptian Scarabs, it
is true, have been published since that date, but
these works treat of private collections and do not
claim to deal with the subject in its entirety or
even in a scientific manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>A long residence, extending over several years,
at Thebes, the centre of the Upper Egyptian Scarab
market, and the place where the best imitation Scarabs
are now manufactured, has, I may claim, given
me exceptional opportunities for studying this class
of Ancient Egyptian antiquities and its allied forms.
For some years it was my custom to pay a weekly
visit to the Luxor antiquity shops, with the object of
examining these and other articles in the dealers’
hands; and, latterly, scarcely a week has passed
during my winter’s sojourn on the banks of the Nile
but that someone, Egyptologist, collector, tourist,
or dealer, has consulted me as to the genuineness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>reading, etc., of Scarabs that they have either purchased
or intended to buy. The frequency of these
appeals, and the ignorance so generally displayed
by the traveller in speaking of Egyptian Scarabs,
convinced me that I could at least advance a step
or two on what had been previously written on the
subject; so, after classifying my notes and visiting
and studying the principal collections of England
and the Continent, I have prepared the following
Introduction to the Study of Egyptian Seals, which
will, I venture to hope, be useful to Students and
Collectors.</p>

<p class='c007'>That I have spared no pains in order to make
this book as complete as possible will, I think, be
obvious to anyone who will take the trouble to read
the letterpress and examine the plates. About one
thousand three hundred specimens of Egyptian Seals
and Signet-rings are figured, but these have been
selected from drawings of some seven thousand, and
from an examination of over thirty thousand examples.
It may be noticed that the splendid collection preserved
in the National Museum at Cairo has been
drawn from but sparingly: this is due to the fact
that M. Maspero had already commissioned me to
prepare and publish a separate catalogue of the unique
collection which is in that great savant’s care. The
manuscript of this catalogue is now finished, and it
will be published early in the coming year.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>I have to thank the Keepers of Public Museums
and many owners of Private Collections for the
courtesy and kindness that they have shown in
allowing me to inspect and draw from the specimens
in their possession. To Prof. Erman and
Dr. Schäfer I am indebted for plaster casts of the
Berlin Museum seals; and to Prof. Petrie I am
indebted for his generosity in placing at my disposal
the magnificent historical series which he has gathered
together at University College, London. To Mr.
Walter Nash, F.S.A., I also wish to express my
grateful thanks for much kindly help and encouragement
in the earlier stages of this work; and in
conclusion I must thank my friends and colleagues
Prof. J. M. Mackay and Mr. John Garstang, for
kindly looking through the proofs of this volume,
and to the latter also for placing at my disposal
the library of the Institute of Archæology of the

<p class='c007'>There are few small objects of antiquity which present
themselves so often to the traveller’s notice in Egypt,
as the little seals of stone, pottery and other material,
carved in various forms and engraved on their base,
or around their circumference, with an ornamental
device or brief hieroglyphic inscription. These seals
are found in a variety of forms; some of them are
cylindrical in shape, others are button-shaped, but by
far the greater number are carved to represent the
scarabaeus beetle standing upon an elliptical base, the
under side of which is engraved with the device or
inscription intended to be impressed upon the sealing
clay. The specimens of this last variety of seal are
universally known as “Scarabs.”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Like the gems of
Greece and Italy, Egyptian seals are generally found
in excellent preservation; other and larger antiquities
usually show on their face the signs of weathering,
or they bear the marks of mutilation by man, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>these interesting little monuments of a long past age
often continue to this day as perfect in their finish
and delicate workmanship as when they first left the
hands of the ancient lapidary. The soil of Egypt
literally teems with them. Thousands have been found
among the <i>débris</i> of long deserted and ruined towns
and temples; the fellah often turns them up in the
soil whilst ploughing his fields, and rich harvests of
these little objects have been gathered by the antiquary
from the myriad tombs that line the desert edge
on both sides of the Nile from Alexandria and El
Arîsh to Aswân. Outside the boundaries of the Nile
Valley also, Egyptian seals are frequently discovered;
and in our museums are to be seen specimens from
Italy, Sicily, Cyprus and the Greek Islands, as well as
from the Eastern shores of the Mediterranean, and
even from as far afield as Nineveh and the valley of
the Euphrates.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Clay impressions of seals.</div>
<p class='c007'>Besides the actual seals, pieces of fine clay bearing
impressions of them are often brought to light by the
excavator; some of these served as sealings to jars of
wine, honey, etc., whilst others had been affixed, like
modern seals of wax, to documents written on papyrus
or leather. The documents to which some of them
had been attached have, unfortunately, too often
perished from decay, or they have been consumed by
fire, but in the stamped clay may still nearly always
be seen the holes for the string, or the markings of
it, by which the seal was fixed to the document:
in some instances even the string itself remains.
These sealings are usually unearthed in excellent
preservation, and they are consequently as useful for
the purposes of study as the seals themselves.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Importance of the study of Egyptian seals.</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>To the student of the history and civilization of
ancient Egypt the importance of these seals and
“sealings” is very great; to him they are as the coins
and gems to the student of Ancient Greece and Rome.
Their range in date is greater than that of any other
class of inscribed monument; the earliest appear as
far back as the very dawn of History, and these little
objects present from that period onward an unbroken
series of such length and completeness that they afford
a most valuable illustration of the early history of the
Nile Valley. In some cases they supply the outline
of a portion of history that was otherwise almost
wholly lost. To them we owe most of our information
regarding the earliest dynasties. For much of our
knowledge of the period intervening between the end
of the Twelfth and the beginning of the Eighteenth
Dynasties we are also indebted to the same class of
monument, while small scarab-shaped seals are as yet
the only extant evidence of several of the Hyksos
kings. Their value as corroborative evidence to other
historical data must not be overlooked, nor can certain
classes of them be lightly cast aside as bric-à-brac
by the archaeologist who sets himself the task of
solving, or of inquiring into, the many problems
that have lately arisen concerning the early people
of the Mediterranean region. To the student of
Ancient Art also they afford a most happy illustration
of the ever-varying styles in vogue in successive
reigns, and their study, as will be seen in
the following pages, often enables us to obtain those
glimpses into the manners and customs of the ancient
Egyptian people which so wonderfully help to elucidate
our view of bygone days and men.</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Importance of the seal in ancient times.</div>
<p class='c007'>It is very difficult for us, especially for those of
us who are not familiar with Eastern civilization, to
realize the great importance that was attached to the
seal by the peoples of the Ancient World. It was far
more of a necessity in everyday life to the people of
antiquity than are our seals to us, or locks and keys
to a modern householder. We still use the seal, it is
true, for our legal documents, sometimes for our
letters, for our post-bags, and occasionally for sealing
up a room. Our Ministers of State have their Seals
of Office, our Corporations and Companies have their
registered official seals, and in our Coronation ceremonies
there is the investiture of the Sovereign with
the Royal Signet Ring. But all these uses of the
seal are as ancient as the pyramid-builders of Memphis.
When we use the signet for sealing our letters or our
legal documents, we are but following in the footsteps
of the Ancient Egyptian, who, many hundred years
before the time of Moses, employed the seal for the
same purpose. When our Ministers of State receive
from the Sovereign their Seals of Office, they are but
following a custom that prevailed in Egypt as early
as the Fourth Millennium before Christ; and when
Edward the Seventh was recently invested with the
Royal Signet Ring at his Coronation, he was but
conforming to a ceremonial act that was recorded
by the rulers of the Nile Valley four thousand years
before William the Norman set foot on the shores of
Britain.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in ancient times the seal was used for many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>purposes for which later inventions have proved more
convenient. At the present day, when closing our
doors, we generally lock them by a spring-bolt, and
only attach a seal on very rare occasions. Locks and
keys, however, are comparatively modern inventions,
for the most ancient in Egypt are not older than the
Roman period; and what locks and keys are to us,
seals were to the people of the Old World. In
ancient times, whenever a man left his home he
always sealed up such parts as contained stores or
other valuable property, so that they might be
rendered secure from the attacks of thieves or slaves.
In like manner boxes containing clothes or personal
ornaments, and jars containing wine or oils, were kept
under seal. The words meaning “to close” and “to
seal” were in Egyptian<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a> synonymous; indeed, to
place a thing “under seal” was an ancient expression
equivalent to the modern one of keeping a thing
“under lock and key.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To secure property from theft was, however, only
one of the many uses of the seal; it was employed
in other equally important ways. In Western
countries, where writing has now become a universal
accomplishment, a person’s written signature is sufficient
to give authority to a document, but in ancient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>times a seal or signet was a necessity to anyone
possessed of even the smallest amount of property,
for without it no legal or other writing could be
attested. Herodotus (I, 195) mentions that everyone
in Babylonia carried a seal, and the same remark
would apply with equal truth to Egypt. In England,
from the Norman Conquest to the time of the taking
effect of the original Statute of Frauds (1677), the seal
was always used to make a writing valid and binding,
and in Scotland every freeholder was required by law
to have a registered seal.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c018'><sup>[3]</sup></a> At the present day
an Eastern, when sealing a letter, smears the seal,
not the document, with the sealing-substance, and
illiterate persons will sometimes use the object nearest
at hand, such as their own finger, which they daub
with ink, and press upon the paper therewith. In
Babylonia the finger-nail was sometimes impressed
into the clay as a seal; while in America, in comparatively
recent times, the eye-tooth impressed upon the
wax has been used for attesting a document (1 Wash.
Va. 42, quoted in <i>American Law Review</i>, Vol.
XXVIII, p. 25). The right hand smeared with ink
and impressed upon a parchment was often used in
mediaeval times in place of a signature, and this, with
the seal impressed beside it, gave rise to the modern
legal expression, “Witness my hand and seal.” The
Sultan’s cipher, which appears on the coinage and
official documents of the Turks, is said to have originated
in this way. The Republic of Ragusa concluded
a commercial treaty with the Ottomans in 1395, by
which it placed itself under their protection, and it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>said that Murad signed the treaty, for lack of a pen,
with his open hand, over which he had smeared some
ink, in the manner of Eastern seals—a veritable sign-manual.
(Stanley Lane-Poole, <i>Turkey</i>, p. 35.) In
ancient times, however, the document was rolled up
and tied with a piece of string, the knot of which was
covered with a pellet of clay and sealed. It was
not only in Egypt that this was so, but in all countries
of the ancient world; in Babylonia and Assyria as
well as in Greece and Italy. A written signature
would have been of no avail to attest a document; a
seal had always to be used. Doubtless in the earliest
times only the most powerful persons possessed seals,
but as civilization advanced the officers of the administration
came to use, besides their own personal seals,
official ones for government purposes. Thus it was
that the seal, being the real instrument of the power
and authority of an office, came to be used as the
symbol of it, and the delivery of an official or State
seal to an individual, gave to that individual the
authority and power to execute the rights and duties
of his office.</p>

<p class='c007'>The various links in the history of the seal which
connect its original employment for securing the contents
of jars, to its latest one for transferring authority
from one person to another, are all preserved, and form
a most interesting object lesson in “social evolution.”
The seal is, indeed, so intimately associated with the
early history of civilization, that it is probable that its
origin goes back to the very institution of the right of
private property. Its early history is full of interest.
If we turn to any of the literatures of the Old World—whether
it be the Egyptian or Babylonian, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Hebraic or Assyrian, the Greek or Roman, it is
the same; we find in each and all of them abundant
passages concerning the importance of the seal and
the various uses that it was put to. Further, if we
study these references, we discover that the signification
of these little objects was everywhere the same,
and if passages were selected from the Egyptian
writers regarding the uses of the seal, it would be
easy to parallel them all from the works of any of
the other Old World peoples. We ought, however,
before discussing the various uses of the seal, to
inquire into its origin.</p>
<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>Origin of the Seal.</span></h3>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Origin of the seal.</div>
<p class='c007'>In his <i>Hand-book of Engraved Gems</i>,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c018'><sup>[4]</sup></a> King has
stated his belief that the use of the seal was almost
coeval with the very institution of the right of private
property, and this seems to be well borne out by what
we actually know of its early history. All the evidence
from Babylonia and Egypt available as to its original
use appears to point in one direction, that it was first
employed for securing household stuff and other moveable
property. In the earlier stages of civilization this
consisted mainly of grain, honey, etc., always liable to
be pilfered by the dishonest slave, or by smaller hands
addicted to picking and stealing. If the proprietor,
therefore, wished to keep his stores of food intact, it
was necessary that he should adopt some means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>checking the pilferer, and the idea early occurred
to him that if he placed his little store in a jar or
other vessel, and covered the mouth of it with a
plaster of mud or clay, it might be protected to a
certain degree against the thief. But merely plastering
the mouth with mud or clay was not enough to preserve
the contents from a skilful plunderer, for he
might easily, and without fear of immediate detection,
remove a capping, steal the contents of a jar, put on
another plaster of mud, and leave no trace of his theft
until the jar was opened by its owner. It was obvious
therefore that a capping of clay alone was not
sufficient. Now it is probable that the mud used
in the process of covering the mouth of the vessel
would often be rolled or smeared flat with a piece
of stick, a joint of a reed, or a flat-bottomed pebble.
Many of these objects must have had natural markings
on them which would have left impressions
on the clay, while these impressions, we can hardly
doubt, were early noticed by the primitive store
owner, and their condition served to tell him whether
or not his closed jars had been tampered with. In this
connection it is interesting to note that Aristophanes
(Thesmo., 424-428), when referring to the custom of
securing doors by sealing them, alludes to certain
[Greek: thripêdesta sphragidia], which were worm-eaten bits of
wood used as rude seals. He speaks of them as
having supplanted the simple seals of olden days, but
they ought rather to be considered as a return to the
early type of “reed” seal. (Muller, <i>Archäol., I.
Kunst.</i>, 97, 2.) From the natural markings upon the
objects employed to smooth the clay, the transition
was easy to some definite device scratched around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the circumference of the stick or reed, or upon the
surface of the stone or pebble, by the owner, and
appropriated to himself as his own peculiar mark.
But as these markings or devices would have had
little weight with a determined thief, we can hardly
doubt that, in Babylonia at any rate, they became
early imbued with a <i>magical</i> signification: so that their
real power would be moral rather than physical. The
reasoning of the lawyers of the Middle Ages regarding
the sealing of contracts was that a <i>seal</i> attracts and
excites caution in illiterate persons, and thereby
operates as a security against fraud.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c018'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The simple scratchings that we find on so many of
the early Egyptian pots were the possessors’ marks;
indeed, King contends that “this instinct of possession
extending itself to the assumption of exclusive ownership
in certain configurations of lines, or rude delineations
of natural objects, is a universal impulse of man’s
nature, and one found existing amongst all savage
nations when first discovered, wheresoever the faintest
trace of social life and polity have begun to develop
themselves.” A great number of these signs Professor
Petrie has preserved in his various records of explorations.
(<i>Cf.</i> his <i>Naqada</i>, p. 44.) Thus the Red Indian
has besides the tribal mark, that of the individual (his
special <i>totem</i>), wherewith to identify his own property,
or the game he may kill. The South Sea Islander
carries the tattooed pattern that distinguishes his
particular family, imprinted upon his own skin, and
also draws the same upon his credentials like a regular
coat of arms. It is therefore in these markings firstly
scratched on pots, and next on rude seals, that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>have the very beginnings of writing; but a long
period probably elapsed before these primitive signs
were combined together to form words. The designs
on these seals were probably at first rough configurations
of lines, which sufficiently served their purpose if
they could be readily identified by the owner; but after
a time these primitive figures seem to have given place
to rude delineations of natural objects which expressed
the name of the owner, like the Greek coins of Rhodes
(a rose); of Melitaea (a bee), and were consequently
looked upon as his particular mark. We have not as
yet got back in Egypt to such primitive forms, but on
Greek gems and coins this <i>type parlant</i>, “figured
speech,” is well known.</p>

<p class='c007'>The original forms of the two great groups of
Egyptian seals we have in the piece of notched reed
and in the small scratched pebble; the first the true
prototype of the cylinder, both in form and in mode
of application; the second as clearly the original of
the stamp seal. Simple as the invention of these two
forms and the art of sealing may now appear, the
discovery that an impression of a seal could be
obtained by pressing it on clay or other plastic
substance was nevertheless one of the most
momentous that has yet been made, and the seal-impression
furthermore suggested the idea of decoration
in bas-relief. From the invention of the simple
seal to the complex printing-press with its moveable
types appears a long way to travel, but that we have
the germ of this great invention in the simple seal is
obvious when we come to think of it. The old
Egyptian or Babylonian who first took an impression of
his signet on a lump of plastic clay, had discovered the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>principle of printing, though it took the human mind
many hundred years before the next great step was
made, that of smearing some black or coloured substance
upon the seal and taking a “print” of it on
plaster, as in the tomb of Thothmes IV (<i>circa</i> <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>
1400), and in ink on a papyrus of the Ptolemaic age.</p>
<h3 class='c019'>4. <span class='sc'>Various Uses of the Seal.</span></h3>
<h4 class='c020'>(<i>a</i>) <i>For securing Property.</i></h4>

<p class='c021'>It has been suggested in a preceding paragraph
that the original use of the seal was for securing stores
of food from dishonest servants; and this statement
is corroborated by the fact that the earliest “sealings”
that have been found in Egypt are from jars that were
used for storing wine, honey, grain, and other food
stuffs. Figures 1 and 2 represent two jars found by
M. de Morgan in a First Dynasty cemetery in Upper
Egypt,<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c018'><sup>[6]</sup></a> (<i>circa</i> <span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 3500), and the general system of
sealing jars and large vessels may be clearly seen from
these examples. The mouth of the jar, it will be
observed, was first covered by an inverted plate or cup
of pottery (fig. 1), in order to prevent the wet clay
(the [Greek: gê sêmagtris], “sealing earth,” of the Greeks)
used in the process of closing the mouth from falling
into the jar. Upon and around this was plastered a
high cone of clay (fig. 2), mixed with palm fibre, and
carefully smoothed, so as to take easily the impression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>of the cylinder seal, which was rolled across it at right
angles. Generally two impressions of the same seal
are found on each clay cone, but sometimes two or
more impressions upon the same cone occur from
<i>different</i> seals. This shows the great care that was
given in early times to secure the contents of a vessel
from thievish servants, a fact which is emphasised by
our sometimes finding that a jar had often two <i>separate</i>
sealings, one below the other, the outer coat being put
on while the inner one was still damp. “Thus,”
writes Professor Petrie of some clay cones of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>kind which he found at Abydos, “often a quite illegible
cone may yet yield a good inscription by carefully
knocking away the outer coat.”<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c018'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p><span class='small'>Figs. 3 and 4.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>This system of sealing large jars with high clay
cones apparently lasted on till the beginning of the
sixteenth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>; then another kind of sealing is
met with. In the place of the high clay cone, a clay cap
with flat top was used, the flat top and sometimes the
sides being impressed with a wooden stamp. Later
still, at the time of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, the
early inverted cap or plate gave way to a pottery cap
or bung, which was secured in place by string or linen
bands, and covered with a rounded cap of plaster.
There is an interesting specimen of a complete jar
neck bearing the stamp of Amasis, with clay and
plaster sealing still fixed to it, found at Tell Defenneh
(see figs. 3 and 4); it is important as showing the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>elaborate system of sealing jars at that time in vogue.
Firstly, a large bung of pottery (fig. 3), made hollow,
was put into the mouth of the jar. This was then
fastened down by linen bands, the ends of which were
tied up in the middle, and a lump of sealing clay fixed
upon it and impressed with six different seals of
inspectors. Although this clay had crumbled and
been washed out by rains in the course of ages, it
still left a cast in the plaster showing the seals as
they appear in fig. 4. After the six inspectors had
each put his seal on it, the jar was sent out to the
plasterer, who capped the whole top with a head of
plaster, and sealed it with the royal name in its oval-cartouche.
Even these elaborate precautions, it would
seem, did not suffice to secure the contents of this
particular amphora from the thief, for the jar neck, as
Professor Petrie remarks, is an instance of a successful
attack upon the royal stores. The cap of plaster has
been bored through just at the edge of the jar, and
the large bung inside smashed through, so as to
enable the thief to reach freely the wine. The piece
of plaster broken out here is shown missing in fig. 4,
though it was found in the jar; the hole just shows
the edge of the neck, and was filled up with a scrap
of the old plaster and a smear of new of a different
quality; no attempt was made to imitate the missing
part of the cartouche, and this probably raised the
cellarer’s suspicion, and made him break off and
preserve the whole jar neck as evidence. (Petrie,
<i>Defenneh</i>, p. 72.)</p>

<p class='c007'>This method of securing the contents of large
jars and amphorae lasted on far into Roman times.
Horace mentions as a test of a good tempered house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>master, that he did not go wild with passion even if
he found that a seal of a wine jar had been broken.
And even at the present day the traveller on the Nile
may still see boats, at certain seasons of the year,
floating down stream from Erment, Kûs, and other
centres of the sugar industry, laden with molasses in
peculiar jars (<i>ballalîs</i>), secured, in place of the early
bung and the earlier inverted plates, by a plug of sugar
cane leaves thrust into the mouth of the vessel, and
plastered over with a thick cap of white clay.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For securing the contents of smaller vessels the
Egyptians had another method. This was by
stretching over the mouth a piece of skin or beaten
metal, which was then firmly tied down by a cord, the
two ends and knot of which were covered by a pellet
of clay, and impressed by a small stamp or scarab (see
figs. 5, 6, and 7).</p>

<p class='c007'>An illustration of a man actually engaged in the
process of covering up a jar of honey has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>preserved in a tomb at Abusîr; he is fastening the

him is the legend, <i>Khetem bati</i>,

<p class='c007'>The beautiful dolomite marble
and carnelian vases found in the
tomb of King Khasekhemui (<i>circa</i>
3300 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) at Abydos are secured
in this way. Each of these has a
cover of thick gold foil fitted over the
top, and tied down with a double turn
of twisted gold wire,
over the tie of which a small lump of clay
is fixed, which in this instance has not
been impressed with a seal, but merely
pressed together by the fingers. Generally
the pellet of clay to be “sealed”
was placed on the top of the jar (as in
figs. 5 and 7), but sometimes it covered
the knot at the side (as in fig. 9). The
same manner of securing the mouth of
a jar still survives in the way our liqueur
bottles, etc., are often
sealed, and in the way we
close our jam pots, except that in the
latter case we no longer find it necessary
to attach a seal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The contents of bags and sacks were
also secured by means of the seal; a
piece of cord was tied round the neck,
the knot of which was immersed in a
pellet of clay and “sealed” (see fig. 10). A large
number of broken seals of this kind have been found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>in Egypt, and sealed bags containing gold dust and
other materials are often figured in the ancient paintings
of the tombs. To the custom of sealing bags
Job alludes (xiv, 17). In the story of Hor-ded-ef we
read of certain midwives who had assisted in bringing
into the world a child, being rewarded by the father
with “a bushel of barley,” which is straightway sent
to the brewhouse to be kept under the midwives’ seal.
Our modern post bags are rendered secure from being
examined by unauthorised persons in exactly the same
manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Ancient Egyptians, it has already been remarked, were
unacquainted with the use of locks and keys, hence we find
that they employed their seals for the purpose of securing
the doors of their houses and storerooms. These latter,
indeed, were termed
<img src="images/i018.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
<i>Khetemu</i>, “sealed rooms,” and they are
frequently alluded to in the ancient inscriptions:<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c018'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Such
storehouses in foreign lands were provision depôts for the
Egyptian troops or garrisons. Government storehouses were,
of course, in charge of officials who kept them under their
seals. Nebuaiu (<i>circa</i> 1500 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), for
instance, proudly boasts that the treasury of the Temple of
Osiris was kept “under his signet ring,” and the Vezîr
Rekhmara (<i>circa</i> 1500 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) tells us that it
was his duty to “seal up all the precious things in the
temple of Amen,”<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c018'><sup>[9]</sup></a> and that all the bags of gold dust and
other valuables were “under his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>signet.”<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c018'><sup>[10]</sup></a> When a storeroom was opened, the official
responsible for the things contained in it appeared
in person and sealed it up again when the stores were
taken out.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are many passages in the papyri which
tend to show how great was the care taken to prevent
irresponsible hands from pilfering.<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c018'><sup>[11]</sup></a> The storehouses
of private people were probably in the care of the
housewife, or some other woman of the household, for
when scarab seals are discovered in graves, it has been
noticed that they are usually found at the side of, or
near to, the body of a female.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c018'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Thus it is probable
that in Egypt, as in other countries, it was the matron
of the household who had charge of the grain and
other provisions, and her little string of seals has its
direct lineal descendant in our modern housekeeper’s
bunch of keys. “How happy the times,” wrote Pliny,
“how truly innocent, in which no seal was ever put to
anything; at the present day, on the contrary, our
very food even and our drink have to be preserved
from theft, through the agency of the ring.” The
modern “wedding ring” originated in the custom of the
man presenting his wife, on her marriage, with a seal,
which she was to use for sealing up her stores of provisions,
etc. At first these seals were worn suspended
from a string of beads around the neck. Sometimes
they were strung on a cord which was tied round the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>wrist, and at a later period they were secured to the
finger by a piece of string or wire. This wire and
seal developed into the signet-ring. Then, with the
introduction of locks and keys, it was the key-ring that
was given by the husband to his wife. These key-rings,
however, were soon found to be too cumbersome
to be worn with comfort on the finger, and so a plain
band of metal was given to the bride with a key.
“The key,” writes Cicero (Ph. 2. 28), “was given to
the bride on entering her home, to signify that she was
appointed mistress of the house (<i>mater familias</i>)”; it
was, in fact, used by her to lock up her store-room,
and in case she was divorced it was taken away from
her. At the present day, if the ring is not forthcoming
at a wedding, the key of the chancel door can be used
instead.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manner of sealing doors was very simple. In
the case of single doors a wooden peg with projecting
head was fixed in the jamb and another
in the door (see fig. 11). When the
door was closed the two pegs would
be near to one another, so that a
piece of string could be easily tied
round them. This string having been
securely fastened by a knot, the knot
was then covered with clay, and the clay impressed
by seal, thus making it impossible to open
the door without destroying the seal or removing
the pegs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Folding doors were secured by a sliding bolt, but
such bolts of course gave no security against a
thief, so they also were sealed. They were shaped
as in fig. 12, with a groove running across the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>centre; a piece of string was stretched across this
groove, and then, after pellets
of clay had been put on the
two ends, it was sealed down
as shown in the figure.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Fig. 12.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>An interesting reference
to this last method of sealing
doors occurs in the well
known inscription of Piankhy
preserved in the Cairo
Museum. This Ethiopian
king, after his victorious
journey through Egypt, goes
to Heliopolis to present offerings of flowers, etc.,
to Ra, the famous god of that town. Proceeding
to the shrine of the deity, Piankhy relates that “he
stood alone,” that he “broke the seals” and “slid
back the door bolt,” opened “the double doors” and
saw his father Ra in the holy shrine. After performing
certain ceremonies therein, he goes on to tell us
that the doors were again shut, “clay was applied” to
them, which was then sealed by the king’s own hand.
Herodotus also, it may be remembered, refers to the
Egyptian custom of sealing up doors, in the story of
Rhampsinitus and the clever thief, who succeeded in
pilfering the royal treasury by means of a loose stone
in the wall of it. When the king happened to open
the chamber, says the historian, he was astonished at
seeing the vessels deficient in treasure, but he was
unable to accuse anyone, as the seals were unbroken
and the chamber well secured.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sealings to tomb doors, the Egyptian’s “eternal
habitation,” being required to be permanent, were much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>more elaborate.<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c018'><sup>[13]</sup></a> After the mourners had retired, and
the door had been closed, clay was smeared round the
juncture of it with the lintel, jambs and threshold, and
then stamped all over by the seal of the priest in charge.</p>

<p class='c007'>As in the case of doors of houses and store-chambers,
so also with boxes, the lids were sealed
down to secure their contents.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>On nearly all ancient Egyptian boxes that have
been found are to be seen two knobs (or the holes
into which they were fastened), one on the lid, the
other on the box itself. Fig. 13 shows how these were
placed, and with a piece of string, a lump of clay and
a seal, it was an easy matter to secure the contents;
all that had to be done was to follow the same process
that has already been described for securing doors.</p>

<h4 class='c020'>(<i>b</i>) <i>For authenticating Documents, etc.</i></h4>
<p class='c021'>With the advance of civilization, and the development
of the art and practice of writing, the seal began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>to be employed for documents also. Till very recent
times writing has been an accomplishment of few
except professional scribes, hence it was natural that
seals which bore the personal badge or mark of the
owner, began to be used by those who could not write
their names for giving that authenticity and authority
to a document which is now more usually conferred by
a written signature. Legal documents were therefore
attested by the seal, and a legal contract was known in
Egypt by the name
<img src="images/i026a.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
 <i>Khetemt</i>, “the sealed.”<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c018'><sup>[14]</sup></a>
But the method of attaching the seal to the document
was different in ancient times to that of the present
day. The old Egyptian, instead of impressing with
his signet the surface of the sheet of papyrus, used
to roll it up,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c018'><sup>[15]</sup></a> tie it round with string, and then, after
knotting the string in the middle of the roll, he affixed
the clay to the knot and sealed it (see fig. 14). Thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>the roll could not be opened, and consequently the
writing of it could not be altered nor new matter introduced
without the seal being first broken, and the mere
breaking of the seal would be legal proof enough to
show that the document had been tampered with. It
is not till the Ptolemaïc period that there is an instance
of a document <i>stamped</i> with ink,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c018'><sup>[16]</sup></a> although the stamp
in paint has been shown to be as early as the
Eighteenth Dynasty.<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c018'><sup>[17]</sup></a> A familiar instance of the use
of the seal for legal documents is given by the prophet
Jeremiah. Having bought a field of Hanameel, he
payed the owner seventeen shekels of silver for it;
then subscribed the evidence and sealed it. This
being done, he took the evidence of the purchaser,
“both that which was sealed according to the law and
custom and that which was open,” and gave it to
Baruch in order that it might be put in an earthen
vessel, and so preserved in case of any dispute.
(Jeremiah xxxii, 9-14.)</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was not only legal documents that were
attested by the signet; letters also were sealed up by
the sender before they left his hands,<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c018'><sup>[18]</sup></a> and several
such letters, with the seals still unbroken, have been
found by the excavator. The aim of the signet in
this connection was of course to afford proof of the
identity of the sender, and to warrant the contents of
the letter. The importance attached to the seal at
present in the East is so great, that without one no
document is regarded as authentic.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>From the use for authenticating documents, the
seal came to be employed for another purpose—that
of authenticating the purity or weight of a piece of
gold or other metal; the stamp upon the coin being
the government guarantee of the fineness and weight
of the piece of metal. It has often been supposed that
the specimens of the scarab class of Egyptian seals
were used as tokens of value, that they represented the
small change of the Pharaohs. In support of this
interpretation a remark of Plato, to the effect that “in
Ethiopia engraved stones were used as money,” has
often been quoted. It is of course true that the
Egyptians had no coined money of their own before
the time of the Macedonian Conquest; taxes were
collected and salaries were paid in kind, and all trade was
done by barter, as in Central Africa at the present day.
The idea, however, that scarabs themselves were used
for the purposes of barter, or as tokens of exchange, is
not supported by the inscriptions, or by any of the
scenes depicted on the monuments. But we do find,
and this is very important, that during the Hyksos
period (<i>circa</i> 1700 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>),<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c018'><sup>[19]</sup></a> and later under Amenhetep III
(<i>circa</i> 1400 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>),<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c018'><sup>[20]</sup></a> the <i>Khetem</i> or “seal” is given as a
measure of value, although here it is probable that it
was not the seal itself that is meant, but the <i>impression</i>
of it upon another substance. The Athenian General
Timotheus, Polyaemus relates, being in want of money
to pay his troops, “issued his own seal” for coin, and
this substitute was accepted by the traders and market
people confiding in his honour. This can only mean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>that <i>impressions</i> of his signet on clay, or some other
substance, were put into circulation as representatives
of value, and so received by the sellers. It is in the
impression of a seal or stamp upon a piece of gold or
other metal that we have the origin of coined money.</p>

<p class='c007'>The study of the early history of coined money
is a most curious one. Rude peoples pass from barter
to the use of metallic currency; and the most general
article of wealth is taken as the standard to which,
either as a multiple or a fraction, all other possessions
are adjusted.<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c018'><sup>[21]</sup></a> In Greece, as in Italy, the ox was
the unit of value, and in Italy<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c018'><sup>[22]</sup></a> a piece of metal was
stamped with the impression of an animal (<i>nota
pecudum</i>), whence it was termed <i>pecunia</i>,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c018'><sup>[23]</sup></a> but when
and by whom such a stamp was first placed on “the
bar or piece of metal it is, of course, impossible to
say.” The Egyptian inscriptions, fortunately, throw
some light on this subject, for as early at least as
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 1700, a
<img src="images/i026a.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
 <i>khetem</i> is mentioned as a unit of
value for metals, while “an ox” is valued as one seal.
Furthermore, the word
<img src="images/i026b.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
<i>khetem</i>, determined by
an ox, actually occurs as a measure of value, and means
a seal with the figure of an ox stamped on it, or an ox
skin sealed.<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c018'><sup>[24]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c020'>(<i>c</i>) <i>For Transference of Authority.</i></h4>

<p class='c021'>We have just seen that the affixing of a seal
to a document gave to that document its validity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>and binding force, and it is now not difficult to realize
that, being the real instrument of the power and
authority of an office, it should have become the
symbol of it. The delivery therefore of the seal
or signet either by the king or by his minister,
committed to the individual the authority and power
to execute the rights and duties of his office. The
Egyptian monarch himself was invested at his
Coronation<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c018'><sup>[25]</sup></a> with the Royal Signet,<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c018'><sup>[26]</sup></a> upon which his
name and titles were engraved; this was as important
a part of the insignia of royalty as his sceptre or his
crown. In an early text (<i>circa</i> 2500 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) it is said
that “Mer-en-Ra maketh his appearance as king, he
hath taken possession of his signet (<i>sah</i>) and of his
throne.”<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c018'><sup>[27]</sup></a> The word for signet is here
<img src="images/i027a.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
 <i>Sah</i>
(variants
<img src="images/i027b.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
 and
<img src="images/i027c.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
<i>Sah</i>, note the necklace
and cylinder seal as determinative), and the signet was
repeatedly used in ancient Egypt to denote a man of
noble rank, one who was allowed to carry a signet with
the royal name engraven upon it. Osiris is named
<i>Sahu</i>, “seal bearer” of the gods whom he has called
into existence, and a hymn<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c018'><sup>[28]</sup></a> calls him the glorious
<i>Sahu</i> among the <i>sahus</i>. The Prince Khnemhetep
(2000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), at Beni Hasan, says of himself that he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>distinguished above all the king’s nobles <i>(sahu)</i>; that
is to say, the order of men bearing the signet or sign
of investiture. A mummified person is also called
<i>Sahu</i>, in virtue of investiture.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c018'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Great Seals of State were as important in
ancient Egypt as they are in this country, and it was
only by the king bestowing his own seal, or one of the
Great Seals of State, on one of his subjects, that he
could delegate his authority. In the Biblical account
of Joseph we read, “and Pharaoh said unto Joseph,
see, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt. And
Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it
upon Joseph’s hand ... and made him ruler
over all the land of Egypt.” That this ceremony was
true, and that the giving of the seal or ring of office
by the king, or by one of his ministers, on the appointment
of a high government official, was indeed usual,
is proved by several inscriptions: at the time of the
middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Amenhetep III
(1450 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) places “the two lands” in the “hands” of
the Vezîr Ptahmes, and “the signet rings of the
Horus” (<i>i.e.</i>, the Sovereign) upon his fingers.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c018'><sup>[30]</sup></a> In
a scene in the tomb of Hûy at Thebes, which
is here (Pl. II) published for the first time, the
Chancellor of King Tutânkhamen, 1350 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>, presents
the gold signet ring of the office of Royal Son (<i>i.e.</i>,
Viceroy) of Ethiopia “to the Prince Hûy, in order
that the office of the Royal Son of Ethiopia may be
made to flourish.”</p>

  <h3 class='c019'>5. <span class='sc'>The Officials Concerned in its use.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c021'>As the seal was put to such varied and important
uses in Ancient Egypt, it is no wonder that many
officials of the Government were concerned in its
employment. There were
<img src="images/i029a.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
<i>khetemtiu</i>,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c018'><sup>[31]</sup></a>
“sealers” (singular
<img src="images/i029b.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
<i>khetemu</i>, “a sealer”),
attached to almost every department of the public
service,<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c018'><sup>[32]</sup></a> as well as to all the religious institutions of the
country; and even wealthy noblemen<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c018'><sup>[33]</sup></a> usually had one
or more of these “sealers” in their household, whose
duty it was to give out from the <i>khetemu</i>, “sealed rooms”
or “store rooms,” the provisions and other private
property required by the great man or by his household.
So important was it that the process of sealing jars,
boxes, and doors should be done properly, that
<img src="images/i029c.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
<i>seḥez</i>,<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c018'><sup>[34]</sup></a> “instructors,” in the art were employed.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>A scene in a tomb at Sakkara<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c018'><sup>[35]</sup></a> shows one of
these officials carrying a pail of mud with a ladle
in it, going to instruct his pupils. These “sealers”
formed a regularly organized body, and served
under a
<img src="images/i030a.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
<i>mer</i> or “superintendent.”<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c018'><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The reader’s attention has already been drawn
to the fact that the monarch was invested at his
coronation with a Royal Signet, upon which his
name and titles were engraved. In the earlier
periods of Egyptian history this Royal Signet was,
doubtless, either worn by the monarch himself or
carried in some secure way about his person. We
do not read in the inscriptions of the earliest
dynasties of any “Keeper of the Royal Seal,” as
we find so frequently alluded to in the hieroglyphic
texts from the Middle Kingdom onwards, and it
would consequently appear as if the king himself in
those early times attended to the business connected
with his Treasury Department.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two important officials of the oldest period, however, were
closely concerned with the use of the seal, and their titles
were derived from its name. One of these was the “Sealer of
the Honey [jars]”; the other was the “Divine Sealer,”
“Sealer of the God.” The first title<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c018'><sup>[37]</sup></a>
<img src="images/i030b.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
“the Sealer of the
Honey [jars],” was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>perhaps, the oldest of the many hundreds of titles
that we find at all periods of Egyptian history, and
from the Third Dynasty onwards there was probably
not a man of less than royal rank who would not
have been proud to bear it. It originally meant,
as we have said, “the Sealer of the Honey [jars]”
honey being the greatest of all primitive luxuries,
and its use reserved for the king’s table. This title
must therefore be regarded as a relic of the most
extreme antiquity, and it certainly goes back to the
time before the use of wine in the Nile Valley. At
the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty (<i>circa</i> 3000 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>),
however, its meaning had probably become already
obsolete, and from that period onwards it meant
nothing more than a “Royal Sealer,”<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c018'><sup>[38]</sup></a> or one entitled
to use a seal with the monarch’s name engraven upon
it. Doubtless there were several of these officers
employed in the royal palaces to look after the
security of the king’s private property, and it was the
duty of some of them to accompany the sovereign
on his various military expeditions.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c018'><sup>[39]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In contradistinction to this secular title we find
the
<img src="images/i031c.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
“Divine Sealer,” the priest who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>charge of the temple treasure, furniture, and goods
that were kept under the temple seals. This title,
like the one that we have just discussed, occurs
also at an early period, and continued in use till
very late times.<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c018'><sup>[40]</sup></a> These “Divine Sealers” were
attached to the service of various gods, or they
were employed by the religious authorities of certain
districts. In the first case they are specified as
“of Amen,”<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c018'><sup>[41]</sup></a> “of Horus,” etc.; while in the second
as “of Abydos,”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c018'><sup>[42]</sup></a> “of Thebes,” etc. It is possible
that they were placed under a <i>mer</i><a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c018'><sup>[43]</sup></a> or “Superintendent,”
but the title is so rare that this was not
usually the case. It was the Divine Sealer’s duty
to obtain and supervise the transport of stone for the
temple buildings,<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c018'><sup>[44]</sup></a> and to pay for and, if necessary,
to collect in far distant countries precious things for
the service of the gods. In order to obtain stone
for statues or for temple buildings, he sometimes led
semi-military expeditions to quarries far in the
deserts,<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c018'><sup>[45]</sup></a> and when it was necessary to convey the
huge blocks of granite and other material down the
river, he was usually placed in command of the
transport ships.<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c018'><sup>[46]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>From the time of the Middle Kingdom<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c018'><sup>[47]</sup></a> (<i>circa</i>
<span class='fss'>B.C.</span> 2000) onwards the title
<img src="images/i033a.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
<i>mer khetem</i>,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c018'><sup>[48]</sup></a>
“Superintendent” or “Keeper of the (Royal) Seal”<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c018'><sup>[49]</sup></a> is
constantly occurring in the hieroglyphic inscriptions.
During the first half of the Twelfth Dynasty, while each
province was yet ruled over by semi-independent chieftains,
there appears to have been a Keeper of the (Royal) Seal
employed in the administration of each nome,<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c018'><sup>[50]</sup></a> whose duty
it was to collect and transmit treasure to the central
office. Next to the chieftain himself, he was perhaps the
most important personage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>in the province, for he had control over its revenues,
and all its public works were carried out under his
supervision. Baqt, the Keeper of the (Royal) Seal
in the Oryx nome, supervised the excavation and
adornment of Khnemhetep’s magnificent monument
at Beni Hasan.<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c018'><sup>[51]</sup></a> When that great nomarch’s
officials defiled before him, the Keeper of the (Royal)
Seal stood in the place of honour<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c018'><sup>[52]</sup></a> behind the <i>uhem</i>
or “Herald,” and in front of the <i>mer meshau</i> or
“General of the Troops.” He was the nomarch’s

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>About the middle of the Twelfth Dynasty a great
change appears to have taken place in the political
constitution of Egypt; we no longer hear of the
Chieftains of Nomes or Provinces, and it seems that
the Government, for a short time at least, became
much more strictly centralized than it had ever been
before. With this centralization of the administration
several new offices were created, the provincial
“Keepers of the (Royal) Seal” appear to have been
suppressed, and <i>adenus</i>, “wakîls” or “deputies” of
the Chief Keeper, appointed in their stead. The
Treasury Department, however, was still presided
over by a single<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c018'><sup>[57]</sup></a> “Keeper of the Royal Seal,” who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>henceforth was one of the most important and
powerful personages in the realm;<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c018'><sup>[58]</sup></a> he became, in
fact, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c018'><sup>[59]</sup></a> an Lord
Chancellor, Keeper of the Seal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately we have no long inscription recording
this great official’s duties, as we have in the case
of the Vezîr,<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c018'><sup>[60]</sup></a> so it is only by gathering a fact here
and there from many sources that we can obtain any
idea of his multifarious duties. That he had charge
of the Government stores, and supervised everything
connected with the <i>bêt el mâl</i> or Treasury, is certain;<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c018'><sup>[61]</sup></a>
he had also to be responsible for the payment of all
Government bills. If any important public monument
had to be erected,<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c018'><sup>[62]</sup></a> or if any government business
was to be undertaken, it was his duty, together with
his staff of assistants, to make all necessary arrangements
regarding the payment of the employés, which
must have been a most onerous task, when we remember
that the Egyptians possessed no coined money
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>until after the time of Alexander the Great. The
supervision of the taxation of the country appears also
to have been placed in the Chancellor’s hands, and it
was his custom, as it still is with the heads of the
departments of the various services of the Khedive’s
administration, to make an annual tour of inspection
throughout the length and breadth of the country.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c018'><sup>[63]</sup></a>
In time of war a number of his officers accompanied
the military expeditions, and when a town was
plundered by the royal troops, they took possession of
the spoil, some of which was kept for the Treasury,
while the rest was given to the temples as an offering
to the gods.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c018'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But not only did the Egyptian Chancellor have
charge of everything connected with the Treasury, he
seems also to have had a considerable share of the
responsibility of appointing various State officials.
We have already referred to the story of Joseph’s
appointment to the Vezîrate, in which case the Seal or
Signet of office was given by the king personally.
With other officials, however, it seems to have been
the custom for the Chancellor to deliver the Seal, and
this ceremonial in a bureaucratic country such as
Egypt then was, must have entailed a vast amount of
time. Possessing the authority to appoint high
officers, and also the means of controlling the State
Treasury, it is no wonder that these old Chancellors
attained to a great degree of power, and there seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>reason to believe that more than one dynasty had its
origin in a Chancellor’s family.</p>

<p class='c007'>So many and various were the duties of the
Keeper of the (Royal) Seal, that it is hardly matter
for surprise if we find that he employed a large staff
of assistants to help him. Among these the
<img src="images/i038a.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>,
“Deputy of the Keeper of the (Royal) Seal,”<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c018'><sup>[65]</sup></a> appears
to have been the most important. When his chief
was absent from the capital on one of the official tours
of inspection through the country, this <i>adenu</i> or
“deputy” was left in charge of the central office, and
the duty naturally devolved upon him of looking after
the permanent staff of the Treasury Department. This
staff consisted of:—</p>

<p class='c007'>(1) A
<img src="images/i038b.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
 “Chief
Overseer of the Courtyard of the Keeper of the (Royal)
Seal,”<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c018'><sup>[66]</sup></a> an official who was, I believe, deputed to
personally supervise everything that went in or out of the
<i>Bêt el mal</i> or Treasury. There was also</p>

<p class='c007'>(2) A
<img src="images/i038c.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
 or
“Overseer of the Courtyard of the Keeper of the (Royal)
Seal.”<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c018'><sup>[67]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(3) A
<img src="images/i038d.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
 or
“Overseer of the Courtyard of the Office of the Keeper of
the (Royal) Seal.”<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c018'><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>(4) Several
<img src="images/i039a.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
 “Assistants.”<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c018'><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>(5) A
<img src="images/i039b.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
 “Chief Scribe,”<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c018'><sup>[70]</sup></a> and several</p>

<p class='c007'>(6)
<img src="images/i039c.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
 “Scribes,”<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c018'><sup>[71]</sup></a> who had their own</p>

<p class='c007'><img src="images/i039d.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
 or “men servants?” These scribes of
the Chancellor were very important officials: they
were intrusted with official seals, and allowed to
transact on their own responsibility important business
affairs connected with the State. They appear generally
with the title
<img src="images/i039e.jpg" height="25px" alt=""/>
 “Scribe in Charge
of the Seal,” or, more literally, “he who writes with
an Official Seal.” They are found under this title
only towards the end of the Twelfth Dynasty, and
their services were retained by the bureaucratic
kings of the Thirteenth Dynasty, but no mention
occurs of them in later times. They were employed
in writing official documents, in keeping accounts, and
in fixing prices to be paid for wages of labourers.
From inscriptions that have been preserved, it would
seem that each town<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c018'><sup>[72]</sup></a> had its own “Scribe in Charge
of the Seal,” and we read of a “Scribe in Charge of
the Seal of the labour bureau” in a Thirteenth Dynasty
papyrus.<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c018'><sup>[73]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Besides the foregoing officials, who were doubtless
paid by the Government, the Chancellor had also his
private staff to manage his own estates and affairs.
Among these may be mentioned<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c018'><sup>[74]</sup></a> a <i>mer per</i>, or
“Steward;”<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c018'><sup>[75]</sup></a> a <i>mer shenti</i>, or “Superintendent of the
Granary;”<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c018'><sup>[76]</sup></a> a <i>sesh sha</i>, or “letter writer;”<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c018'><sup>[77]</sup></a> and an
<i>ari aa</i>, or “doorkeeper.”<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c018'><sup>[78]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The profession of the seal engraver was obviously
an important one in Egypt, but we do not find any
references to his occupation in the ancient literature.
He was called the <i>mer kesti</i>, and the scarab-seal of
one named Amenŷ-ankh is in the possession of
Mr. Arthur Evans (see <a href='#pl-xvii'>Pl. XVII</a>, 27).<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c018'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c019'>6. <span class='sc'>Seal Engravers and the<br /> Technique of Seal Engraving.</span></h3>

<p class='c021'>The process of making a seal out of hard stone
was simple enough; a suitable piece of amethyst,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>jasper, or other material was taken, cut into the shape
of a cylinder, stamp, or scarabaeus beetle, and polished.
The device or inscription was then engraved in
intaglio. In the case of steatite, schist, and other soft
stones, the device was sometimes drawn in ink<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c018'><sup>[80]</sup></a> before
being cut, and the seal was finished by being dipped
into a vitreous glaze in order to harden it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pottery and paste scarab seals were moulded in
terra-cotta moulds. A lump of potter’s clay or paste
was taken, then pressed into a dusted mould, and
flattened with a knife at the bottom. It was then
shaken out and left to dry. When dry, the scarab
was placed in the engraver’s hands, and the inscription
or device was cut on the elliptical base; the whole
was then sometimes coated with vitreous glaze.</p>

<p class='c007'>The glazes used were of different colours, varying
from pale blue to deep violet, and from pale to dark
green. Sometimes red and yellow glazes were also
employed. Often the glazes have changed colour,
and sometimes only faint traces of it remain on a seal.
Seals that are now brown in colour were originally
green, while grey or white examples were generally
blue.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tools used were apparently of four kinds: a
knife, a graver, a simple drill, and a tubular drill.</p>

<p class='c007'>The knife, perhaps of hardened bronze, was used
for cutting the specimens of the softer materials
into shape, while the graver, of flint or obsidian,
was employed for cutting the device or inscription.
Herodotus mentions<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c018'><sup>[81]</sup></a> that the Ethiopians pointed their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>arrows with the same sort of hard stone or flint that
was used for engraving signets.</p>

<p class='c007'>The simple drill, used for drilling the soft stone
seals and for engraving those of the hard stone class,
consisted of a metal drill with handle, the butt end of
which revolved inside a stone or wooden cap which
the engraver held in his hand, and was thus able to
direct the point to the right place. The drill itself
was made to revolve by means of rapidly moving
forwards and backwards by a bow, the string of which
was wound round the stick of the drill. Carpenters
and cabinet workers in the East still use a similar
bow drill at the present day.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The tubular drill was also worked in the same way
with a bow, but instead of the drill being pointed as
in the simple drill, it was tubular. With hard stones
both these kinds of drill were used, with emery powder
and oil or water.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>THE VARIETIES OF EGYPTIAN SEALS.</h2>
</div>
<div  class='c001'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Varieties of Egyptian seals.</div>
<p class='c007'>It has already been remarked that Egyptian seals
may be divided into two great groups: namely (1)
those of cylindrical shape, which were <i>rolled</i> over the
clay or other substance to be impressed; and (2)
those with a flat base, which were used as <i>stamps</i>.
Both these types probably originated in Western
Asia. The first group comprises all (<i>a</i>) cylinder
seals; to the second belong all (<i>b</i>) hemi-cylinder and
cone shaped seals, (<i>c</i>) button shaped seals, (<i>d</i>) scarab
shaped seals, (<i>e</i>) plaques and other miscellaneous
forms, and (f) Signet rings.</p>
<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>Cylinder Seals.</span></h3>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Cylinder seals.</div>
<p class='c007'>The oldest seals that have been discovered in
Egypt are of cylindrical shape, hence their name,
cylinders, or more correctly, cylinder-seals. They
range in size from half an inch to three and a half
inches in length, and from a quarter of an inch to
three quarters of an inch in diameter. They are
pierced longitudinally with a hole, the diameter of
which varies from a size just sufficient to receive a
small thread of linen, to an aperture in which an
ordinary sized finger can be thrust. The two ends
are always quite plain, the engraving, in intaglio, being
confined to the convex surface, which, as a rule, is
parallel to the axis. In some specimens, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the surface is hollowed in such a way that the diameter
of the cylinder is greater at the ends than in the
middle, but such cylinders are rare, and generally show
traces of nearly erased signs appearing through the
engraving; they must therefore be considered as
having had their original inscription ground down in
order to be re-engraved with other characters; they
are in fact cylinders that have been re-used.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How used.</div>
<p class='c007'>When the cylinder seal was required for sealing, it
was gently but firmly rolled over the soft clay or other
substance destined to receive the impression. To
make a good and continuous sealing with an unmounted
cylinder is not, however, an easy matter, and
consequently we find that this class of seal was often
mounted by inserting a rod of metal through its
aperture, the ends of which rod projected from the
cylinder, so that it could be easily held by the forefinger
and thumb, while the rod, serving as an axle,
enabled the operator to keep the seal in place, and at
the same time to preserve an even pressure whilst
rolling it over the clay. This metal rod was sometimes
finished off at one end into a kind of boss, while
the other end was coiled round to form a loop, so that
the cylinder might be attached to a necklace or string
(fig. 17). The cylinder seals of kings and nobles had
more elaborate mountings, and their ends were often
encased in gold, as in a specimen found by Dr. Reisner
near Girgeh, and as in an example figured in a Fourth
Dynasty tomb at Medûm (fig. 18). Another method
of mounting is shown in a hieroglyph (fig. 19) from a
Fifth Dynasty Tomb at Sakkara. Here the cylinder
appears to be mounted on a metal rod, the projecting
ends of which were fixed to either side of a small
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>frame, with a handle in which the cylinder seal could
revolve. By holding the handle and dragging the
cylinder over the clay to be impressed, the seal would
revolve as easily and evenly as a wheel on its axle,
and consequently leave a good and firm impression
behind. The greater number of cylinders, however,
are found without any trace of having been mounted,
and as many show signs of wear on the edges inside
the hole, we may conclude that they were generally
simply threaded on a cord, which, for security sake,
was either hung by the owner round his neck or waist,
or tied to his girdle or garment. It is possible that
sometimes the cylinders were kept in boxes. (<i>Abydos</i>,
II, p. 25, 12.) Prof. Petrie has discovered an ivory
panel of a box for King Den engraved with a group
of hieroglyphics, suggesting that the box had contained
the gold seal of judgment of the king.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Its history.</div>
<p class='c007'>The history of cylinder seals in Egypt covers the
period from prehistoric times to the end of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>Twenty-sixth Dynasty, but they were only in general
use down to the end of the Twelfth Dynasty, when
they gave place to the more convenient
“scarab” form of seal. They may be
most conveniently classified according to
the subjects found engraved upon them,
but it is also an important matter for the
student to carefully note the shape and
the size of their perforation, two points
which are often of considerable importance
when it is desired to accurately date a specimen.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Varieties of shape and perforation.</div>
<p class='c007'>The earliest examples that are at present known
are of a peculiarly short thick type, with a narrow hole
running through them (fig. 20); they
are almost identical in shape with the
Chaldean and early Babylonian cylinder
seals, and consequently may be
thought to indicate a connection at a
very remote period between the civilizations
of Western Asia and Egypt—a
connection which is still more
apparent when we come to consider
the subjects engraved on many of the
seals themselves.<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c018'><sup>[82]</sup></a> At a later period
appears another variety, which is long
and thick (see fig. <a href='#fig-21'>21</a>), but with a
much larger perforation than that of
the cylinders of the earliest period.
These two varieties have been found
together in tombs of the beginning
of the First Dynasty, but the earlier disappears
soon after the reign of King Zet (First Dynasty),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>while the later one was in general use down to the
end of the Sixth Dynasty.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the beginning of the Middle Kingdom we
have another type of cylinder seal making its appearance;
this resembles more a long cylindrical bead
(fig. 22), with an aperture of only sufficient size to
admit of its being strung on a thin cord or thread.
The examples dating from the time of Amenemhat III
and his immediate successors are often of fairly large
size, but with narrow perforation, while those of the
latter part of the Thirteenth Dynasty are always much
smaller, and dwindle down in shape to mere cylindrical
beads.</p>

<p class='c007'>The few cylinder seals of the Hyksos period
that are known are of medium size (fig. <a href='#fig-22'>23</a>), with
narrow perforation, and are somewhat like those of the
earlier half of the Twelfth Dynasty. The specimens
of the Eighteenth and later Dynasties vary in size
considerably, but they always have a narrow perforation
(fig. 24).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Material.</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Although comparatively few specimens have been
found in wood, it is clear from many clay impressions<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c018'><sup>[83]</sup></a>
that cylinder seals were generally made of this
material. One example of wood was found at
Abydos<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c018'><sup>[84]</sup></a> having the inscription written upon it in
ink, showing that the design was sketched out on
the cylinder by a scribe before it was cut by the
engraver. Next to wood, the commonest material in
early times was black steatite; but a few specimens
have been found of hæmatite, green jasper, and ivory.
Copper and bronze examples appear during the Fifth
and Sixth Dynasties, and glazed pottery specimens
appear a little later. White or grey steatite, coated
with blue or green glaze, was the favourite material of
the Twelfth Dynasty kings and officials, and this
material was in vogue till the Nineteenth Dynasty.
At the beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty carnelian
cylinder seals make their appearance, and the latest
specimen known is of this hard stone.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The subjects engraved upon Egyptian cylinder seals.</div>
<p class='c007'>The subjects engraved upon Egyptian cylinder
seals may be grouped into three well defined
divisions. Firstly, there is a small class the engraving
on which depicts figures of men and animals,
sometimes very beautifully executed. Secondly, a
much larger class, represented by several hundred
specimens, which bear true hieroglyphic inscriptions.
Thirdly, a very small class with scroll patterns or
other ornamental devices.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>I. Figures of men and animals.</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>The specimens of the first class require to be
studied in some detail, for they contain elements which
are of great importance to the comparative archaeologist.
A typical example is given in fig. 25, and a
second will be found in Pl. III, fig. 1. One of the
most distinctive features of these seals is the double-forequartered
animal, a feature which occurs again on
the button-shaped seals<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c018'><sup>[85]</sup></a> of the period intervening
between the Sixth and the Twelfth Dynasties. This
does not appear to be an Upper Egyptian <i>motif</i>, but
one common to the Delta and to an early civilization
of Western Asia.</p>

improbable that in the cylinders of this class we have
relics of a Delta civilization which was distinct from
that of Middle and Upper Egypt. In point of date the
specimens of this group range from prehistoric times to
about the end of the Old Kingdom (<i>circa</i> 2500 <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>),
when they appear to have entirely died out.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>II. Hieroglyphic inscriptions.</div>
<p class='c007'>Of the second group of Egyptian cylinder seals,
namely, those bearing hieroglyphic inscriptions, a
large number are figured in the plates, but a glance at
the reproductions of them will show that they are of
several different types, and that they may be more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>conveniently studied if they are grouped into subdivisions.
The examples of an earlier period than the
First Dynasty may be subdivided into two separate
classes.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Primitive cylinder-seals. Class I.</div>
<p class='c007'>In the first may be placed all those bearing any
primitive hieroglyphic signs which appear to give
personal names written in a horizontal line (fig. 26).
A remarkable feature of this class is, that on most of
the examples occurs a curious figure of a stork with
head turned over its back.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Class II.</div>
<p class='c007'>To the second class belong all those seals which
give personal names, with a seated figure as determinative,
and always written in a horizontal line (see
fig. 27). This seated figure is very unlike that which
occurs in later hieroglyphic inscriptions; it is always
represented as wearing a long wig of hair, which falls
behind the head to some distance below the shoulders,
and in front of the figure is generally shown a table
upon which are figured loaves of bread. The
standard-sign <i>Neith</i> is often found on cylinder-seals of
this type, and would perhaps point to the Western
Delta as the place of their origin: the stork, so
common on specimens on Class I, seems, however
never to occur in them.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Class III.</div>
<p class='c007'>With the beginning of the historical period
appears another class, which is characterized by rude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>hieroglyphic inscriptions written in vertical columns,
which columns are generally divided by lines (see
fig. 28) These are the true prototypes of the
Egyptian cylinder-seals of the Old and Middle
Kingdoms.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cylinder-seals of Dynastic times.</div>
<p class='c007'>Cylinder-seals of Dynastic times which bear
hieroglyphic inscriptions may be divided into groups
according to the meaning of their inscriptions. Thus
we have (<span class='fss'>I</span>) a group which bears the names and titles
of kings and other royal personages; (<span class='fss'>II</span>) a group of
officials which bear the king’s name and the title
of the office or official, but <i>never</i> the personal name
of the latter; and (<span class='fss'>III</span>) a small group of private
seals which bear the name and titles of the former.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Cylinder-seals bearing Royal names.</div>
<p class='c007'>One of the earliest Royal seals that we know of
is that of Narmer, the predecessor of Mena; it is
reproduced in outline in fig. 29, and gives merely
the Horus-name of the king. The Royal seal of
Zer, Mena’s successor, gives besides the name of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the monarch, a <i>figure</i> of him seated and wearing
the two crowns, typical of Upper and Lower Egypt
(see fig. 30). At the time of the Third Dynasty
the Royal name is first put into an oval ring or cartouche,
and a little later the name is generally accompanied
by the statement that the king is “beloved of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the gods,” or beloved “of the goddess Hathor.” With
Men-kau-ra the title <i>Sa Ra</i>, “Son of Ra,” first
appears,<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c018'><sup>[90]</sup></a> but it is not till the Twelfth Dynasty that
we find the full name of a king cut on a single seal.
At the time of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Dynasties
the king’s name is generally given in a cartouche
either with<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c018'><sup>[91]</sup></a> or without<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c018'><sup>[92]</sup></a> his official titles, and then
it is often accompanied by the statement that he is
“beloved of Sebek”<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c018'><sup>[93]</sup></a> of some specified locality. A
few cylinder-seals of this period also bear the names
of two or more kings.<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c018'><sup>[94]</sup></a> The only specimens of the
Hyksos period that are known up to the present
are those of Khŷan; one of these is in the Museum
at Athens,<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c018'><sup>[95]</sup></a> another is in the possession of Signor
Lanzone,<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c018'><sup>[96]</sup></a> and a third is in the Cairo Museum (see
fig. <a href='#fig-22'>23</a>). Two remarkable cylinders of about the
same period are figured in Pl. VII, 2, and VIII, 1;
while to the latter half of the Hyksos period must
be placed the cylinder-seal of King Antef (Nub-kheper-ra),
of the early Seventeenth Dynasty, which
is figured in Pl. VII, 12. The Royal cylinder-seals
of the Eighteenth Dynasty generally bear the king’s
name in the cartouche without other decorations,<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c018'><sup>[97]</sup></a>
but some have also a figure of the king, or figures
of gods and animals.<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c018'><sup>[98]</sup></a> The large specimen reproduced
in outline on Pl. VIII, 7, is the seal of Sety I
of the Nineteenth Dynasty, and is one the latest
specimens of Royal cylinder-seal known.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Official cylinder-seals.</div>
<p class='c007'>Official cylinder-seals are of two kinds. They
either bear (<i>a</i>) the name of the king together with
the title of the office or official, but not the personal
name of the latter; or (<i>b</i>) simply the title of the
official without the name of the king. The Royal
name appears once or thrice on the seals of the
first group, and, if repeated, the rest of the
inscription is placed between the names;
the titles and name of the king are almost
always written in a direction contrary to
that of the other words, apparently as a
mark of respect (see fig. 31). These
official cylinder-seals range in date from
the First Dynasty to the time of Pepŷ II
of the Sixth Dynasty, when they became
superseded by the seals of the stamp form.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cylinder-seals bearing the name and titles of
officials are also known (see fig. 32). These appear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>to have been used as the private seals of the persons
whose names are engraved upon them. They date
from the Twelfth Dynasty into the Twenty-Sixth
but are very rare.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>III. Scroll patterns, etc.</div>
<p class='c007'>A very small class of cylinder-seal bears scroll
patterns or geometrical devices.<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c018'><sup>[99]</sup></a> These appear for
the first time during the intermediate period between
the end of the Sixth and the beginning of the Twelfth
Dynasty, when they are generally made of glazed
pottery, and are very coarsely executed. The specimens
of a later time (probably Seventeenth or early
Eighteenth Dynasty) are of glazed steatite, and
beautifully cut.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Button-shaped seals.</div>
<p class='c007'>A small, but very distinctive class of seal, cut in
the shape of a button, with flat circular disc and loop
at the back (see fig. 33), has recently been found in
Egypt, and closely akin to this class is another, but
much smaller one, the examples of which are cut in
the form of a hemi-cylinder (sometimes with projecting
base), and pierced through their length by a hole of
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span> Hemi-cylinders.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
sufficient size to admit of a fine piece of string being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>inserted (see fig. 34). Some of the button-shaped
seals have ornamented backs: instead of the loop
being plain as in fig. 39, it is cut in such a way
as to represent two hawks’ heads, or the fore-parts
of two lions back to back. Occasionally we also
find specimens in the shape of a hippopotamus’
head (fig. 40).</p>

neck as pendants.<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c018'><sup>[100]</sup></a> Occasionally they have been found

<p class='c007'>These two classes of seal were in use in Egypt for
a limited period only. They appear for the first time
in graves belonging to the end of the Sixth Dynasty,<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c018'><sup>[101]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>and during the period intervening between that time
and the beginning of the Middle Kingdom they were
the commonest form of seal in use.<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c018'><sup>[102]</sup></a> Before the end

disappeared.</p>

seals are distinctive, and they are certainly not

rarely occur (<i>cf.</i> fig. 41), and when they do, they
are clearly imitations of Egyptian characters made
apparently by foreigners. The motives for some of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the designs are clear; thus a common type is that
which has already been noticed as occurring on a
class of early cylinder-seal—the linked forequarters of
gazelles and other animals symmetrically arranged
(<i>cf.</i> figs. 39, 40); sometimes also we find a curious
running figure of a man (fig. 42, and <i>cf.</i> fig. 35), and
occasionally a tortoise, a lizard (<i>cf.</i> fig. 43), or a spider
(<i>cf.</i> fig. 44). Conventional and geometrical patterns
are also found, the meander<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c018'><sup>[104]</sup></a> and the radiated disc
being perhaps the most frequent. See also figs. 45-6.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Historical importance of button-shaped seals.</div>
<p class='c007'>The button-shaped seals are of considerable
interest to the student of comparative archaeology,
and they are certainly not Upper Egyptian in their
origin. The earlier forms have, moreover, no affinity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>to the Mycenaean series of designs, and, as Mr. Petrie<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c018'><sup>[105]</sup></a>
has remarked, the spirals, butterfly, cuttlefish and other
characteristic types are absent. On the other hand,
they have several links which connect them to the
Greek Island and Cretan class of seals, and also to
some found in Italy, from which we may perhaps infer
that they are of common origin.<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c018'><sup>[106]</sup></a> An almost exact
reproduction of some of these steatite buttons in clay
actually occurs in the Italian <i>terramare</i>, and in the
Ligurian cave deposits of neolithic and æneolithic
periods. Mr. A. Evans writes, “The clay stamp from
the <i>terramare</i> of Montale in the Modenese, represented
in fig. 52, the top of which is now broken,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>was probably once perforated, is not only analogous
in form but bears a simple geometrical design almost
identical with that on an early steatite
button-seal from Knossos.”<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c018'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

</div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Material.</div>
<p class='c007'>Specimens of button-seals have been
found in gold, amethyst, carnelian, lapis
lazuli, black steatite, steatite glazed blue
or green, ivory, bone, and blue or green glazed
pottery. The hemi-cylinders are only as yet known
in steatite glazed blue or green.</p>
<h3 class='c019'>3. <span class='sc'>Scarab-shaped Seals.</span></h3>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Scarab-shaped seals.</div>
<p class='c007'>By far the commonest form of Egyptian seal was
that cut in the shape of the scarabaeus beetle, hence
its name, “Scarab” or “Scarabaeus,” from the Greek
name of the insect, [Greek: skarabos] or [Greek: skarabeios] (Latin
scarabaeus).<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c018'><sup>[108]</sup></a> The beetle is represented standing on
an elliptical base, on which is engraved in intaglio
a hieroglyphic inscription or ornamental pattern. The
seals of this class range in size from a fifth of an inch
in length to four or even five inches, but the commonest
size is about three-quarters of an inch, by
half-an-inch broad and a quarter of an inch high.
They are nearly always pierced longitudinally with
a hole, the size of which is usually just sufficient to
receive a thread or thin wire.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How used.</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>When the scarab-seal was used for sealing, it was
simply pressed upon the clay destined to receive the
impression, just as a signet is used at the present
day. A large number of clay-sealings from scarabs
have been found in different localities in Egypt, and
bear witness to the manner in which this class of seal
was used.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>How mounted.</div>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Fig. 53.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The greater number of scarabs were probably
simply strung on a thread of string, by which they
were secured to the garment or girdle of the person
to whom they belonged. Sometimes
they were worn on the finger,
attached by a piece of string (fig. 53),
or they were simply mounted as
swivels to metal rings, in which they
revolved (fig. 54), or they were enclosed
in a metal frame or <i>funda</i> in
order to protect their edges from injury, and then
mounted as swivels to metal rings (fig. 55). Such
mountings often give us a clue to the date of these
objects, and will be found described in detail in
the section on signet-rings.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>Current ideas regarding scarabs.</div>
<p class='c007'>The beetle upon which these little seals are
modelled, and from which they take their name,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>is the <i>Scarabaeus sacer</i> of entomologists, an insect
which is remarkable not only for the structure and
situation of its hind legs, which give it a singular
appearance when walking, but also for its habit of
rolling up balls of excrementitious matter in which
the female encloses her eggs. The balls of dung
the insect rolls about the sand until they become
coated with a thick layer of dust, and grow to
a size often as large as the insect itself. The
Egyptians, who were always keen observers of
nature, early noticed this remarkable habit, and
selected the scarabaeus as the symbol of their god
Khepera, “he who turns” or “rolls;” for the conception
was that Khepera caused the sun to move
across the sky, as the beetle causes its ball to roll
along the sand. There was also another reason
for the Egyptian linking the insect and the god
together: as the young beetle came forth from
the ball of clay it was believed that a female beetle
did not exist, that it was consequently the “only-begotten,”
because it was a “creature self-produced
and not conceived by a female.” Hence we find
that for this reason it is said to have been taken as
the emblem of Khepera, the “Father of the Gods,”
who created all things out of clay. Consequently
we find that several archaeologists attach a sacred
meaning to the myriads of scarabs that have been
found in Egypt; they regard them simply as emblems
of the god Khepera.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is, however, as a “charm” or “amulet” having
magical qualities that the scarab is usually spoken
of at the present day, and that a few of them had
a magical signification is proved beyond a doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>by the inscriptions that are found engraved upon
some of them. There is also a mention of a scarab
being employed for the purposes of magic in a
magical receipt book<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c018'><sup>[109]</sup></a> of the period intervening
between the end of the Twelfth and the beginning
of the Eighteenth Dynasty; but it must here be
remarked that in this case the scarab is called a
<i>khetem</i> or “seal,” which clearly shows that the
Egyptians regarded these objects primarily as seals,
to whatever other uses they may have put them.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the fact that scarabs bearing royal names
are often found with mummies in the tombs, it has
been conjectured that they were laid with the dead
“to place them under the protection of their former
lord in the next world, and to ensure that they should
follow him and share in all the immunities and
privileges that so great a divine being would enjoy
with the gods.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Another theory regarding Egyptian scarabs is
that they were employed as tokens of value, but, as
we have already remarked,<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c018'><sup>[110]</sup></a> the idea that they were
used for the purposes of barter or exchange is not
supported by the inscriptions, or by any of the scenes
depicted on the walls of the ancient tombs or temples.
The statement of Plato that engraved stones were
used in Ethiopia as money refers to Ethiopia alone
and not to Egypt, for there was certainly no coined
money in the Nile Valley until the period of the
Ptolemies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other archaeologists there are who hold that
these objects were made and used for the purpose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>of personal decoration; but although there is every
reason to believe that they were often, perhaps
generally, worn on the person, it by no means
follows that this was their only or even their principal
use. At the present day we often carry our seals
on our watch chains, or we wear our signets as rings
on our fingers, but we cannot rightly say that these
articles were made solely for the adornment of the
person.</p>

<p class='c007'>These are the principal theories regarding the use
and signification of the Egyptian scarab which have
been set forth in works hitherto published on the
subject, but archaeologists are beginning to abandon
these views in favour of another and a simpler one,
that has not as yet been discussed at length, but that
recognizes in these little objects nothing more than a
simple seal or signet.<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c018'><sup>[111]</sup></a> This use is borne witness to
by the great number of actual impressions of them on
bits of clay that have served as seals to letters and
other documents, as well as to boxes, vases, and bags
that have been found in the ruins of ancient towns;
and these impressions include every variety of scarab—royal,
official, and private, as well as those bearing
figures of animals and ornamental patterns. The
large number of scarabs which bear the names of
officials and private persons also points to the same
conclusion, for it is impossible to regard the examples
of this extensive group in any other light than as the
“direct forerunners of the private seals which are so
universal in the East at the present day.” A large
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>number of scarabs have also been dug up by excavators
which are mounted in metal bands (<i>fundae</i>),
showing that they had served as bezels to rings, and
many early rings with scarab bezels may be seen in
our museums; these can hardly be regarded in any
other light than as signet-rings.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been urged against this interpretation that
the manufacture of scarabs in such profusion as we
find them, precludes the idea that they were signets
and nothing more, but it seems to have been forgotten
that many millions of people must have lived
during the several thousand years of ancient Egyptian
history. The fact also that so many bear the royal
superscription of one and the same king has likewise
been brought forward as a serious objection to
the theory that royal scarabs were used as seals; but
here again the two kings whose names are most often
found on these objects are the two—Thothmes III
and Rameses II—whose reigns were the longest of
all the Egyptian monarchs, and they must have employed
a great number of officials entitled to use the
royal seals during their long administrations. It is in
the light of seals, therefore, that scarabs are considered
in the present volume.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their history.</div>
<p class='c007'>It is difficult to fix the precise period at which the
scarab form of seal first appears in history. It is a
noteworthy fact, however, that not a single specimen
has yet been authenticated from a grave of a date
anterior to the Sixth Dynasty. The remarkable tombs
discovered by Petrie, de Morgan and others, at Abydos,
Nagada, and Bêt Khalâf, though they contained not a
single scarab or impression of one, produced a large
series of clay sealings used for wine jars, etc., exhibiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>impressions of cylinder seals. It is remarkable
also that in the extensive cemetery of Dendera, where
there were many remains of the Sixth to Eleventh
Dynasties, not a single scarab was found which could
be attributed to an earlier period than the Twelfth
Dynasty, and a similar result was obtained from the
cemetery at Hu of the same period. In Mr. Garstang’s
excavations at Beni Hasan, out of eight hundred
tombs of the period that were opened and examined,
not one inscribed scarab was found of the Eleventh
and early Twelfth Dynasties. These facts would
lead one to suppose that at least scarabs were not in
general use in Egypt until the middle of the Twelfth
Dynasty.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='small'>Fig. 56.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A few scarabs, however, bear the names of kings
of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Dynasties, but from
the forms of the backs, the glaze and general technique,
they all appear to me to be of a much later period
than that of the monarchs whose names they bear.
The names anterior to the Twelfth Dynasty that
occur upon such scarabs are Mena, Khufu, Kha-ef-ra,
Men-kau-ra, Unas, Merŷ-ra (Pepŷ I) and Mer-en-ra.
The Mena scarabs are admitted by Prof. Petrie and
other Egyptian archaeologists to be of a much later
date than the Old Kingdom. That scarabs of Khufu,
Kha-ef-ra and Men-kau-ra were made during the
Eighteenth and later dynasties there can be no
question. In the Cairo Museum are four scarabs, all
found together by Mariette at Sakkara, which are of
exactly the same modelling, material and glaze: one
bears the name of Khufu, another that of Nefer-ka-ra,
the third that of Nefer-ra, while the fourth is of
Amenardes of the Twenty-Fourth Dynasty. In a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>private collection in Cairo is a scarab bearing the name
of Kha-ef-ra in green glazed steatite, with cutting,
form of back, and glaze exactly similar to that of a
well-known type of Thothmes III. All the Men-kau-ra
scarabs are also undoubtedly not earlier than the
period of the Eighteenth Dynasty. The Unas scarabs
bear a great resemblance to a certain class of the
Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties: they are generally
coarsely cut, and the glaze has turned a dull
brown. The only scarab of Merŷ-ra known is of the
same style as the scarabs of the Thirteenth
Dynasty, and Merŷ-ra was a fairly common
personal name at that period. About the
Mer-en-ra example I am inclined to believe
that it is perhaps contemporary with the
king whose name it bears, for it is of glazed pottery,
and closely resembles in style and technique a
very small and distinctive class of scarab-seal which
has been recently found in association
with button-shaped seals in
graves of the intermediate period
between the end of the Old Kingdom
and the beginning of the Twelfth
Dynasty.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c018'><sup>[112]</sup></a> That scarabs sometimes
bear the names of two or more kings,
is also another proof that we cannot
always treat of them as contemporary
with the kings whose names they
bear. Thus scarabs are known of
Thothmes I, III, and Setŷ I, of
Thothmes III and Usertsen III, of
Men-kau-ra and Thothmes III.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>It seems clear, therefore, that scarabs were not
employed in Egypt before the end of the Sixth
Dynasty, and then only very rarely. At the beginning
of the Twelfth Dynasty their use was still
very restricted, but at the middle of that dynasty
they came into general use very quickly, and by the
time of Amenemhat III they seem to have been widespread
in Egypt. From that time onwards to the end
of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty the history of Egyptian
scarab-seals can be traced in an unbroken line; after
the latter period they became very scarce, and finally
disappear early in Roman times.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Geographical range of Egyptian scarab-seals.</div>
<p class='c007'>Many Egyptian scarab-seals have been found in
regions other than the Nile Valley. In Syria they
have been turned up in plenty. In Cyprus, Rhodes,
the Aegean Islands and the Greek mainland, numerous
examples have been found. They have also been
discovered at Crete, in Italy and Sardinia, on the
north coast of Africa, and in Babylonia,—in all
places in fact that had trade relations with the
Egyptians.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Varieties of Shape.</div>
<p class='c007'>The period to which a scarab belongs may often
be determined from its shape and the markings on the
back of the beetle; hence it is important to carefully
note the varieties of form which occur. In fig. 58
will be seen a specimen of a scarab-beetle (the real
<i>Scarabaeus sacer</i><a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c018'><sup>[113]</sup></a>) with the nomenclature of its various
parts described: these names will be used in later
references.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c007'>The earliest examples known are of pottery, glazed,
small in size and somewhat rough in modelling. The
lines are coarse, but distinguish the head, <i>prothorax</i>
and body, with <i>elytra</i> marked. The specimens figured,
No. 59, are from El Mahasna, and are now in the
museum at Cairo. Probably they may be dated, the
discoverer tells me, to the rise of the Middle Kingdom,
just before the Eleventh Dynasty. The example
bearing the name of Mer-en-ra (fig. 56) is of this
class.</p>

</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Twelfth Dynasty.</div>
<p class='c007'>Three varieties of form are characteristic of the
Twelfth Dynasty. The earliest, dated approximately
to the reigns of Usertsen I and Usertsen II, show
the beetle carefully modelled, with <i>clypeus</i> (fig. 60),
<i>prothorax</i> and <i>elytra</i>, as well as the legs, well defined.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Just later, about the time of Amenemhat III, a more
decorative and conventional style appears, in which,
while the lines are treated with more freedom, and
small embellishments are introduced for ornamental
purposes as in fig. 61, the form and details of the
beetle are nevertheless well preserved. A common
form of this date is shown in fig. 62: it is noticeable
that the <i>elytra</i> are not outlined, but the marking of
the head, eyes, and legs appears as in the previous
examples. This type, with slight variations, perseveres,
being traceable through the Hyksos period, and
reflected in specimens of the early Eighteenth
Dynasty.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The closing years of the royal line of the Middle
Kingdom, commonly called the Twelfth and Thirteenth
Dynasties, are marked by a special variety of beetle,
which has a high back (particularly at the <i>prothorax</i>,
where the scarab is thickest) and a narrow waist, produced
by an indent on either side at the point where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span><i>prothorax</i> and <i>elytra</i> adjoin. The head shows <i>clypeus</i>
and eyes: the legs are usually shown in outline only,
while the <i>elytra</i> are not marked. There is a second
type, characteristic also of these times, which is in
reality a development from earlier forms, as may be
seen by comparing the example in fig. 64 with that
previously illustrated in fig. 60. The tendency to
decorative effect seen in this case is further exemplified
by a number of scarabs which seem to follow the
prototype of fig. 61, though failing to preserve the
quality of the lines and cutting.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Figs. 64 and 65.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Hyksos Period.</div>
<p class='c007'>As previously mentioned, the type of back in
which no <i>elytra</i> are shown remains the common
variety through the Hyksos period. A short notch
on each side indicates the point of division of the
<i>prothorax</i> from the body, and in the example shown
in fig. 65 the legs are suggested only. The head and
<i>clypeus</i> are plain; the eye is sometimes represented.
A decorative effect is produced in some instances, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>in fig. 66, by representing hairy legs upon the back
of the beetle. A unique example for the period is
illustrated in fig. 67, where the back is scored with
lines diagonally in each direction. Another typical
form is shown in fig. 68, in which the threading holes
are supported by a ring carved with the scarab, while
the beetle itself is developed apparently from the type
in fig. 63. In such scarabs the hairy legs upon the
back occasionally may be noted. Another Hyksos
type characteristically represents the human head
(fig. 69, and compare the scarab of King Apepŷ
figured in Plate I) upon the body of the scarab with
or without the legs over the back.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Eighteenth Dynasty.</div>
<p class='c007'>With the close of the Hyksos period there is no
discontinuity in the forms of scarab-backs commonly
represented, but there is a marked incoming of new
motives. Fig. 70 well shows the survival in the early
Eighteenth Dynasty of the plain-bodied scarab which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>we have seen surviving throughout the earlier periods.
Marks hitherto naturalistic are seen to be becoming
conventional or decorative, but the form both in outline
and in section is well preserved. In fig. <a href='#fig-70'>71</a>,
however, there is seen a new type, characterised by
the oval base, the curving of the lines separating the
<i>prothorax</i> from the body, and a superiority of technique
evidenced both by symmetry and firm cutting.
Fig. 72 illustrates a development of this tendency in
a highly-finished and decorative specimen, in which
ornamental feeling now predominates for the first time
over the naturalistic. The support of the thread-hole
survives in this instance in the decoration, while the
legs overspread upon a broader margin to the base.
The date of this example is Amenhetep I. But the
typical form of the middle Eighteenth Dynasty is
illustrated by the example shown in fig. <a href='#fig-73'>73</a>, which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>dated by the name of Hatshepsut. The head and
back are well shaped in the section, while the <i>clypeus</i>
and head are clearly and exquisitely cut. The <i>prothorax</i>
is rounded at the base, while in the forepart of
the <i>elytra</i> a small notch is indicated in the wing case
on each side. The legs are sometimes well modelled,
at other times indicated only in outline. A variation
is illustrated in fig. <a href='#fig-74'>74</a>, which dates from the time
of Amenhetep III.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>The Nineteenth Dynasty.</div>
<p class='c007'>With the advent of the Nineteenth Dynasty the
tendency to enlarge the base, and the spreading legs
upon it and around the scarab, becomes typical of the
period, as illustrated in figs. 75, 76. Another numerous
class is of pottery, glazed as before, in which the head
is elongated while the <i>prothorax</i> and <i>elytra</i> are not
outlined. A downward notch on either side of the
forepart of the wing cases, however, indicates the
separation of the <i>prothorax</i> from the body. The
legs stand high, but project only a little (fig. <a href='#fig-77'>77</a>).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>During the reign of Rameses the Great an interesting
decorative motive is introduced in a few examples, of
which figs. 78, 79 are specimens of interest. The
former, in the Amherst Collection, is of ivory, finely
cut. Upon the base is the device of
Rameses in his chariot, while upon the
back is the outline of the beetle, filled
in with his cartouche and emblems.
During the same period the human head
upon the scarab body makes its reappearance
as a device for decoration.</p>
<div class='sidenote'>The Ethiopian dominion.</div>

<p><span class='small'>Fig. 80.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With the Ethiopian dominion a ram’s head (the
emblem of Amen-ra) frequently is found upon the
beetle body (fig. <a href='#fig-80'>80</a>); while sometimes, as shown in
fig. <a href='#fig-81'>81</a>, the body of the scarab is replaced by the
familiar Hathor head with uraei on either side.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The subjects engraved on scarab-seals.</div>
<p class='c007'>The subjects engraved on Egyptian scarab-seals
may be divided into several well-defined groups.
Firstly, there are those which bear hieroglyphic inscriptions.
Secondly, there are
those which bear figures of men,
animals, or flowers; and thirdly,
those which bear geometrical designs,
coil and rope patterns, etc.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>I. Hieroglyphic inscriptions.</div>
<p class='c007'>For the purposes of study the
first group may be subdivided
into: (1) those which are inscribed
with the names of kings and other
royal personages; (2) those which
bear the names of officials and private people; (3) those
which have titles without names; (4) those which represent
the names or figures of deities, and (5) those
which bear good wishes, mottoes, and magic formulae.</p>

<p><span class='small'>Fig. 81.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<div class='sidenote'>(1) Royal names.</div>
<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>The largest class of these objects bear the names
and titles of the Egyptian kings; they are consequently
most valuable for the illustrations they afford
of Egyptian history: some of these names being
scarcely, if at all, known except from these sources.
The information they convey is, of course, usually
very laconic, but sometimes the names are coupled
with some facts connected with them, such as that the
king is the son of a certain prince (Pl. X, 2), or that
he is born of a queen (Pl. X, 3), or that he is beloved
of some god (Pl. XXX, 22), or that he has conquered
the foreigners (Pl. XXVIII, 10).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(2) Private names.</div>
<p class='c007'>Scarab-seals bearing seals of officials and private
persons form the second largest class. They usually
give one or more titles of the official, together with
the personal name. The earliest example known is
one in the Amherst Collection, bearing the name of the
“Mayor Tahutihetep,” from a tomb at El Bersheh, and
the date of it is Usertsen II (Pl. XI, 15). They
were common during the late Twelfth Dynasty and
early intermediate period; they occur fairly often
during the first half of the Eighteenth Dynasty, but
are rarely found after that date. Frequently these
private scarabs are decorated with a scroll pattern or
other ornament, often very beautifully executed.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(3) Titles.</div>
<p class='c007'>A very small number bear titles without personal
names, such as “the courtier” (Pl. XLI, 20), “the
governor of the royal city” (Pl. XLI, 22), “the priest,”
and “the mayor.” These are all of a late date
(Twenty-sixth Dynasty), and are very rare.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(4) Names or figures of deities.</div>
<p class='c007'>Names or figures of deities engraved on scarabs
are common, but they are mostly of the principal gods
and goddesses of Egypt, such as Amen, Amen-Ra
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>(Pl. XLI, 18), Ptah (Pl. XLI, 13), Khensu, Isis,
Hathor (Pl. XLI, 5), Mut, Horus (Pl. XLI, 10), and
Set (Pl. XLI, 15). These date from the beginning of
the Eighteenth onwards to the Twenty-sixth Dynasty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>(5) Good wishes, mottoes, and magic formulae.</div>
<p class='c007'>Scarabs bearing good wishes, mottoes, and magic
formulae are numerous. Some of them not only give
the good wishes, but even the names of the persons
from whom they emanated and to whom they were sent.
Thus the inscription on one in the Petrie Collection
reads: “May Ptah give a Happy New Year, from
the Prince Shashanq to his mother Ka-ra-ma-ma”
(Pl. XL, 8). Others give simply the words, “A
Happy New Year” (Pl. XL, 2), or “May Bast give a
Happy New Year” (Pl. XL, 3). Some read, “If
Amen is behind, there is no fear” (Pl. XXXIX, 27),
while a little plaque in the Hood Collection says,
“I am true of heart” (Pl. XL, 21).</p>

<div class='sidenote'>II. Figures of men and animals, etc.</div>
<p class='c007'>Many scarab-seals bear the figures of men and
animals, the principal animals figured being the lion,
bull, cynocephalus, horse, and gazelle. Birds are also
often engraved, the hawk, the emblem of Horus, being
the commonest. Serpents are very common, and we
also occasionally find combinations of serpents with
animals, sphinxes, griffons, and sometimes beetles and
locusts (see <a href='#pl-XXV'>Pl. XXV</a>). Flowers, such as the lotus,
are frequently found engraved on these seals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hunting scenes on scarab-seals appear for the
first time during the Hyksos period, and a beautifully
cut specimen of this date is in the Ashmolean Museum
at Oxford (Pl. XXV, 26). It represents a king clad in
a striped loin-cloth with fringed edge, and wearing a
curiously-shaped head-dress. Armed with a bow and
arrows, he hunts three ibex-gazelles and a lion among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>bushes of a desert wady. To a later period, probably
not earlier than the Nineteenth Dynasty, belong the
common hunt scarabs of the types figured in Pl. XLII,
33-39. The first and rarest type (Pl. XLII, 33) shows
a hunter with lions and cheetahs chasing a gazelle.
The second and commonest type represents an archer
hunting the lion and other desert animals (Pl. XLII,
35). The third type is more elaborate, and depicts
the hunter riding in a chariot drawn by one or more
horses (Pl. XLII, 37-39), while on other scarabs we
sometimes see the huntsman overtaken by a lion, and
lying flat on the ground, apparently slain (Pl. XLII, 34).
The cutting of these Nineteenth Dynasty hunt scarabs
is generally deep, and the subject is always more or
less coarsely rendered: few specimens bear any trace
of glazing, and when found it is always of an inferior
kind, which has turned brown.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Coil and rope patterns.</div>
<p class='c007'>Scarabs with ornamental devices, such as coils and
twisted rope patterns engraved upon them, appear first
about the reign of Usertsen I, and continued in use to
the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty, after which
period they rarely occur. The date of any single
specimen may generally be determined by the form of
the back, but the glazing and general style of cutting
is also important in this connection. Specimens of the
late Twelfth and early Thirteenth Dynasties are often
fine examples of ornamental art: they are generally
designed with much care, and executed with wonderful
minuteness and delicacy of touch. Finely worked
specimens are also found of the time of Queen
Hatshepsut and Thothmes III. A representative
series of coil and rope-pattern scarabs is given in
Pls. XVIII and XIX. The rope-patterns figured in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>Pl. XIX, 1-3, are of the Hyksos period, while those
on Pl. XVIII, 1-15, 18, range in date from the
Twelfth to the Eighteenth Dynasties. The coil-patterns
given in Pl. XIX, 4, 5, 9, are certainly of
the Hyksos period, while the remainder of the coil
patterns are mainly of the late Twelfth and Eighteenth
Dynasties. Often the continuous loop coil
was used to ornament the scarabs of kings and
officials. The earliest example, indeed the earliest
example of any coil-pattern in Egypt, is found on
a scarab of Usertsen I, most exquisitely worked and
fully developed (fig. <a href='#fig-82'>82</a>).</p>

<p class='c007'>For a long time past it has been thought that
the spiral as a motive in decoration
originated in the Nile Valley, and much
misconception seems to prevail among
archaeologists as to its occurrence in
Egypt. Prof. Petrie says<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c018'><sup>[114]</sup></a> that its
earliest use in the country was for the
decoration of scarabs, and he would
trace the spiral motive back as far as the Fifth
Dynasty. The single scarab that he instances, it
is true, bears the prenomen of Dad-ka-Ra (Assa),
but there is not the slightest reason to make one
believe that this particular specimen is contemporaneous
with the king whose name it bears; the
whole style of it, on the contrary, clearly shows
that it belongs to no earlier a date than the
Eighteenth Dynasty. Prof. Petrie also attributes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>a number of scarabs bearing coil, hook and link
ornamentation to the Sixth and Eighth Dynasties,
but these have been conclusively shown by Fraser<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c018'><sup>[115]</sup></a>
and Griffith<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c018'><sup>[116]</sup></a> to be in reality <i>post</i> rather than <i>pre</i>
Twelfth Dynasty. The fact is that the spiral has
not yet been found on Egyptian monuments of an
older date than the reign of Usertsen I. It was
then used as a motive for decorating a ceiling in
the tomb of a chieftain at Assiut.<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c018'><sup>[117]</sup></a> Employed
architecturally it is not found again until the
beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty, when it was
perhaps the most frequent motive for ceiling decorations
in Theban tombs. In these tombs it is
generally coloured yellow, to represent gold, and it is
highly probable that the ornament itself originated
in metal wire-work.<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c018'><sup>[118]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>At the same time as we find it occurring at Assiut,
we also find the spiral used to decorate a scarab
bearing the prenomen of Usertsen I (fig. 82). On
this specimen the ornament is cut with very great
care and regularity, indicating that the design was “a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>novelty, which had not yet become stereotyped<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c018'><sup>[119]</sup></a> and
reproduced as a matter of course.” The same exquisite
workmanship is found on some scarabs bearing
private names of the time of Amenemhat III or a little
later; and here the continuous coil is combined with
the lotus in a most beautiful design—a continuous coil,
with flowers and buds in the spaces (Pl. XIV, figs.
21-26). It is difficult to believe that such a design
sprang into being fully developed; but nothing has yet
been found in Egypt at all like it of a period anterior
to the Twelfth Dynasty; we must therefore search for
the origin and development of the spiral motive in
ornament elsewhere than in the Nile Valley. We do
not yet know sufficiently the history of the Delta to
say definitely that it did not originate there, but the
probabilities are that we should look for its earliest
employment and development outside the realm of
Egypt.<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c018'><sup>[120]</sup></a> However that may be, the spiral was one of
the most important of the motives of the decorative
art of the ancient world. From very ancient times it
was largely used by the peoples of Western Asia and
the Eastern Mediterranean, and in “the wake of early
commerce it was spread afield to the Danubian basin,
and thence in turn by the valley of the Elbe to the
Amber coast of the North Sea; there to supply the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Scandinavian Bronze Age population with their leading
decorative designs. Adopted by the Celtic tribes
in the Central European area, it took at a somewhat
later date a westerly turn, reached Britain with the
invading Belgae, and finally survived in Irish art.”<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c018'><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<div class='sidenote'>Material. Hard stones, obsidian, etc.</div>
<p class='c007'>Scarabs are made of all kinds of material, from the
hardest obsidian and amethyst, to soft steatite and
even wood. In all ages they were made of hard
stones. Obsidian, spotted diorite, beryl, white quartz,
hematite, amethyst, serpentine, green and red jasper,
as well as red carnelians, lapis lazuli, and turquoise
were all in use from the end of the Twelfth Dynasty
onwards to the Twenty-sixth. Rarely during the
earlier periods were the bases of the hardest stone
specimens engraved; they were usually covered with
a gold plate, upon which the device or inscription was
incised.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Gold, silver, etc.</div>
<p class='c007'>Metal scarabs are very rare: a few of gold, and
two or three of silver are known of the Eighteenth
and Nineteenth Dynasties, while about a dozen examples
of bronze, of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties,
are preserved in our museums.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Glass and cyanus.</div>
<p class='c007'>At the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty glass
first appears, and of the reigns of the Amenheteps III
and IV a number of seals have been found of a beautiful
semitransparent deep blue glass. Of the late
Eighteenth Dynasty a few specimens are known of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>cyanus, an alkaline silicate coloured a deep blue with
carbonate of copper, and this material was used in
increasing quantity till the Twenty-sixth Dynasty.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Schist and steatite.</div>
<p class='c007'>Besides the hard stones enumerated above, shelly-limestone,
schist, and steatite were also employed, and
a few scarabs are known that were made of ivory.
Steatite (or soapstone) was used in the manufacture of
scarabs from the Twelfth to the Twentieth Dynasties,
and by far the greater number of specimens are made
of this material. It is a silicate of magnesium, soft,
easily cut, and at the same time its superior compactness
secures it from being readily broken or
injured, and it is also capable of receiving a higher
finish and much sharper impression of the subject
than porcelain.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>The Glazes.</div>
<p class='c007'>The steatite scarabs were nearly always glazed,
and the glazing often helps to indicate the date of
a specimen. Only by a careful study of a large
number of specimens can the eye be accustomed to
differentiate between the varieties of glazing used at
different periods. A very fine blue glaze of excellent
quality is characteristic of the Twelfth Dynasty, and
green glaze was also often used at this period. Many
shades of blue and green glaze of very hard quality
are found on the specimens of the Thirteenth
Dynasty, and the few Hyksos scarabs that yet retain
their colour show that a green glaze of a poorer
quality was used at that period. The characteristic
glazes of the early Eighteenth Dynasty are green, of
a slightly greyish tint, generally of a fine surface, while
those of the latter half of the dynasty, though coarser
in quality, are often very brilliant in colour, and show a
variety of tints ranging through all the shades of blue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and green. Violet glaze was also employed at this
period. The glazes of the Nineteenth Dynasty are
often poor in quality, and generally of a dark yellowish-green
colour, though sometimes blue and violet. The
colour commonest during the Twentieth and later
period are blue of various shades. It should be
remarked here that the greatest number of scarabs
are brown or white: the brown ones were invariably
coloured green, and the white specimens blue.</p>

<div  class='c000'></div>
<div class='sidenote'>Miscellaneous forms.</div>
<p class='c007'>Besides scarabaei, other forms of seals are met
with in Egypt. Many of them have little models
of men or animals on the back, as human-heads,
symbolic eyes, hippopotami, lions, hedgehogs, ducks,
fish, frogs, flies, crocodiles; while not a few are shaped
like cowries.</p>

<p class='c007'>A large number are also cut in geometrical forms,
tablet-shaped, squares, rectangles, ovals, cubes, and
cones. Like the scarabs, they are all pierced, through
their long axis or diameter, with a narrow cylindrical
hole, and were similarly mounted.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>The figure is that of a male, squatting in the familiar

<p class='c007'>Animal forms are illustrated in the
figs. 85, 86, 87, 88, 89. The first represents
a naturalistic group, a cow
suckling its calf, exquisitely cut in
steatite. It is in the collection of
Captain Timmins in Cairo. The design
upon the base is analogous in its symmetry and the
devices employed to the steatite stamp, fig. <a href='#fig-94'>94</a>, in
the same collection, which probably dates from about
the Eleventh Dynasty. The two stamps, figs. 86
and 87, are very important, one of them being dated
by the cartouche of Mentuhetep of the Eleventh
Dynasty, the other by its analogy, and by the device
of a running figure in line frequently employed upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>the button-seals (fig. <a href='#fig-41'>42</a>, and <i>cf.</i> fig. <a href='#fig-28'>28</a>). Hornets are
employed upon the Karnak three-sided seal, fig. <a href='#fig-86'>86</a>,
which is probably of earlier date, about the close of
the Sixth Dynasty. A further example of this
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Miscellaneous devices.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
character, being a ram with horns, is in the
MacGregor Collection: upon the base is an interesting
pattern in coils, dating probably from the end of
the Twelfth Dynasty. A great number of seals with
cats (fig. <a href='#fig-88'>88</a>), hedgehogs, hippopotami (fig. <a href='#fig-88'>89</a>), and
fish (fig. <a href='#fig-90'>90</a>), date from the time of Thothmes III in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the Eighteenth Dynasty, while those with ducks
(figs. 91, 92), frogs, and flies, seem to be slightly
later, dating from the reign of Amenhetep III.</p>

<p class='c007'>A number of large seals are oval in form; one of
these, with a device of animals incised upon the back,
shown in fig. <a href='#fig-93'>93</a>, bears upon the base the blundered
cartouche of Amenemhat III. One of rectangular
form (fig. <a href='#fig-94'>94</a>) is rather of the nature of a stamp, being
without decoration upon the back other than the
necessary suspension hole in the attachment, while
upon the base is the device previously described as
belonging to the period which precedes the Middle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Kingdom—between the Sixth and Eleventh Dynasties,
from its analogy to the button-seals of that time.
Other stamps are illustrated in figs. 95 and 96,
having oval bases. They date from the Seventeenth
Dynasty, bearing the names of Seqen-en-ra and
Se-Amen. Another stamp (fig. <a href='#fig-97'>97</a>) of larger size, has
a simple handle down the middle of the back. The
device in this case represents a number of captives or
votives below the emblem of Anubis. This class of
stamp, used generally for the sealing up of tomb-doors,
as in the case of the tomb of Thothmes IV at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Thebes, seems to date from the Eighteenth Dynasty.
Fig. 98 represents another common form of the same
period, itself dating to the reign of the emblem upon
it, Thothmes III. A less usual class, dating from the
Twelfth Dynasty, is represented in fig. <a href='#fig-99'>99</a>. The back
in this instance is plain, the form of the stamp resembling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>a slice from a sphere, with the device upon
the plane face. A hole pierces the thickness.
Figs. 100 and 101, represent other objects of this class,
which from its Aegean analogies is of peculiar
importance. The former specimen is dated, from an
inscription on its back, to the reign of Usertsen III;
the coil device is employed in each case. Two
interesting examples are shown in figs. 102 and 103,
the one being of the Eighteenth Dynasty, from its
cutting and its glaze, the other of the Nineteenth
Dynasty, from the cartouche of Rameses II incised
upon it. A late example is that shown in fig. <a href='#fig-104'>104</a>,
and is a common type of the period of the Saïte
renaissance in the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. The inscription
gives the name of Tahuti son of Aahmes,
chief of the scribes of the temple. It is of pottery,
glazed green, and is in the Collection of Captain
Timmins.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>Their history.</div>
<p class='c007'>The earliest examples that we know of are not
older than the middle of the Twelfth Dynasty, but from
that period onwards they are fairly common in Egypt.
A number were found by M. de Morgan, at Dahshûr,
of the date of Usertsen III to Amenemhat III, and
these are all of one type: a scarab
threaded on a piece of gold wire, the
ends of which are twisted round
several times on the back of the
hoop (fig. <a href='#fig-107'>107</a>). At a somewhat later
period we find the gold wire thickened
in the middle to lend additional strength, and the
two ends thrust into the perforation of the scarab.
The specimen illustrated (fig. <a href='#fig-108'>108</a>) dates from the
Thirteenth Dynasty. A second type of this period
is shown in fig. <a href='#fig-108'>109</a>. Here the scarab is mounted in
a gold <i>funda</i> and the perforation is threaded by a wire,
the ends of which are wound tightly round the hoop,
which is made of a separate piece of metal. The same
form survives during the Hyksos period (<i>see</i> Pl. I,
ring of King Apepŷ), and on to the end of the
Eighteenth Dynasty (fig. <a href='#fig-110'>110</a>, and the ring of Hor-em-heb,
Pl. I). With the beginning of the Eighteenth
Dynasty another form appears, that of a plain metal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>ring with the outer surface of the bezel flat and the
inner curved (fig. <a href='#fig-110'>111</a>). This form was rare during
the earlier reigns of the dynasty, but common under
Amenhetep III and Akhenaten (<i>see</i> ring of Akhenaten,
Pl. I), and it survives to the present day. At the
time of Thothmes III, a ring consisting of a plain
hoop beaten out into a lozenge shaped plate occurs
(Pl. XXIX, 31), but it is a very rare form until after the
Twentieth Dynasty. With the reign of Amenhetep III,
pottery rings of all forms are found, and these are
very common till the beginning of the Nineteenth
Dynasty.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PLATE I.<br /> <br />SOME ROYAL SIGNET-RINGS.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c025'>I. Signet-ring of Apepŷ I. In the possession of
Mr. Theodore M. Davis. The bezel is of
green-glazed steatite, carved in the shape of a
scarabaeus-beetle with a human head, and
mounted in a thin gold funda. On the base of
the bezel is engraved in intaglio, and within a
cartouche, the name of the “Good King Aauser-ra
(Apepŷ I), giving life.” The cartouche
is surrounded by a continuous rope-pattern.
The hoop of the ring is of gold, and the bezel
is secured to it by means of a gold wire
running longitudinally through the funda and
scarab, and coiled tightly round its two ends.</p>
<p class='c026'>II. Signet-ring of Amenhetep II. In the Egyptian
Museum of the Louvre. The bezel is of solid
gold, in the form of a rectangular plaque. On
one face are engraved, in intaglio, the titles
and prenomen of Amenhetep II: “The King
of Upper and Lower Egypt, the Lord of the
Two Lands, Aa-kheperu-ra,” the cartouche
being surmounted by two cobras, and resting
on the <i>nub</i>-sign. On the other face are the
titles: <i>Heru</i>, <i>ka nekht</i>, <i>user pehtet</i>, “the
Horus and Mighty Bull, strong in power.”
The bezel is pierced longitudinally by a narrow
hole, and it is fixed to the hoop of the ring by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>means of a rod running through it, and rivetted
to the shoulders.</p>
<p class='c026'>III. Signet-ring of Nefer-ka-ra (Psamtek II). In
the possession of Mr. Walter Nash. A plain
hoop of gold, beaten out into a lozenge-shaped
plate, upon which is cut, in intaglio, the prenomen
of Psamtek II.</p>

<p class='c027'>IV. Signet-ring of Neferu-kheperu-ra Setep-en-ra
(Akh-en-aten). In the possession of Mr. Walter
Nash. A hoop of silver, with massive bezel,
the inner surface of which is curved, and the
outer flat, with the prenomen of Akh-en-aten
engraved upon it.</p>
<p class='c026'>V. Signet-ring of Zeser-kheperu-ra Setep-en-ra
(Hor-em-heb). In the Egyptian Museum of
the Louvre. This is the most remarkable
specimen of an ancient Egyptian signet-ring
known. It is formed of a quadrangular plaque
and a thick hoop, swollen in the middle for
strength, both of solid gold; it weighs
125.50 grs. On one face of the plaque is
engraved, in intaglio, the prenomen of Hor-em-heb,
while on the other is a marching
lion, emblem of royal power, and the words
<i>Neb Khepsh</i>, “Lord of Valiance,” above it.
Upon the two sides are delicately engraved:
(1) a scorpion, and (2) a crocodile. The bezel
is pierced longitudinally through its centre, and
secured to the hoop by means of a thick gold
wire, which threads the bezel, and is coiled
round the two ends of the hoop.</p>

</div>
<p class='c025'>1. “The Mayor of Het-kha-Usertsen and Superintendent
of the Temple ... Senba, justified.”
Alnw. Het-kha-Usertsen was probably the
pyramid town of Usertsen II (Griffith, <i>K.P.</i>,
p. 58). Other mayors of this locality are
recorded in the tomb of Tehuti-hetep at El
Bersheh (Newberry, <i>El.B.</i> I., XXXIII); on a
statue at Alnwick Castle (Birch, <i>Cat. Alnw.</i>,
pp. 60-62), and on a scarab published on
Pl. XIII, 20 of the present work.</p>
<p class='c026'>2. Cylinder-seal of a king with the Horus-name of
Her-tep-tauï, “Chieftain of the Two Lands,”
and “beloved of Sebek, Lord of Sunu.”
Murch. This king certainly belongs to the
beginning of the Thirteenth Dynasty, but his
personal name has not as yet been fixed.</p>
<p class='c026'>3. The full names and titles of king Amenenhat-senb-ef.
Amh. This beautiful cylinder-seal is
of steatite, coated with a fine blue glaze, and
the hieroglyphs are very delicately cut. It was
found at Mohalla (Mualla), opposite Gebelên,
and the monarch whose name it records is
otherwise unknown (<i>cf.</i> my note in <i>P.S.B.A.</i>,
XXI, 282).</p>
<p class='c026'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>4. “Sekhem-khu-tauï-ra, beloved of Sebek, Lord of
Ref-sam (?).” B.M. 3663.</p>
<p class='c026'>5. “The Good God, Uah-ab-ra (Aa-ab), beloved of

Khŷran (Khŷan). In the possession of Signore
Lanzone of Turin.</p>
<p class='c026'>8. A cylinder-seal with decorative coil-pattern. It
was found at Nubt (Petrie, <i>Naqada</i>, LXXXI,
79), and belongs to the intermediate period
between the end of the Twelfth and the
beginning of the Eighteenth Dynasty.</p>
<p class='c026'>9. Cylinder-seal, with interlacing coil-pattern. M-G.
Of the early Intermediate period.</p>
<p class='c026'>10. “The <i>Hek nefer</i>, Good Ruler, Khŷan.” Athens.</p>
<p class='c026'>11. Cylinder-seal, with human figures and cartouches
with hieroglyphic inscriptions of doubtful
reading. P. Hyksos period.</p>
<p class='c026'>12. A green glazed steatite cylinder-seal, bearing the
legend “Kheper-nub-ra,” the prenomen of
Antef V. B.M. 30772. Late Intermediate
period.</p>
<p class='c026'>13. “The Governor of the (Royal) City (<i>i.e.</i>, Thebes)
and Vezir, Ankhu.” Figured in the Brit. Mus.
<i>Add. MS.</i> 29816, f. 193. This vezir lived
under King Khenzer, of the Thirteenth Dynasty
(<i>cf.</i> my note in P.S.B.A. XXII, 64).</p>

I, fig. 147.)</p>
<p class='c029'>31. “The Good God, Lord of two Lands, Nub-ka-ra,
Usertsen.” M-G. This scarab is perhaps a
“late issue,” which might account for the
prenomen of Amenemhat II being joined
to the nomen of an Usertsen; or it may be
a contemporary specimen, the two names
appearing being due to the co-regency of
Amenemhat II and Usertsen II.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PLATE XI.<br /> <br />SCARABS OF OFFICIALS OF THE TWELFTH TO FOURTEENTH DYNASTIES.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c025'>1. “The Governor of the (Royal) City and Vezîr,
Ptah-dedut-senb, justified.” H-P. 3726. A
clay impression of a somewhat similar seal (of
the Vezîr Ŷ-meru) was found by Prof. Petrie
at Abydos.</p>
<p class='c026'>2. “The Governor of the (Royal) City and Vezîr,
Auŷ.” Murch. This Vezîr is mentioned on a
stela in Vien. (No. 117; <i>cf.</i> <i>Rec. des trav.</i>,
IX, 62.)</p>
<p class='c026'>3. “The Scribe of the Vezîr, Ren-ef-senb.” Thomp.</p>
<p class='c026'>4. “The Superintendent of the Seal, Neb-re-sehui.”
L. 6288. Three other scarabs of this official
are known: one is in the v-B. Coll. (Fr. <i>Sc.</i>
90), another is in the Fitzw. Mus. (Budge, <i>Cat.</i>
155), and the third is in Mr. Nahmann’s hands
in Cairo.</p>
<p class='c026'>5. “The Superintendent of the Seal, Up-em-heb.”
Gr.</p>
<p class='c026'>6. “The Superintendent of the Seal, Senba.” Gr.
Another scarab of this official is in the B.M.
(24108, P. <i>Sc.</i> 445.)</p>
<p class='c026'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>7 and 8. “The Superintendent of the Seal, Senb-su-ma.”
(Gr. and M-G.) Several other scarabs
of Senb-su-ma are known. Three are figured
by Petrie (<span class='sc'>Sc.</span> 446-448), from the Louvre,
Petrie and Grant Colls.; other specimens are
in the Cairo Mus., the Amh. Coll. and the
Edws. Coll. A beautiful light blue glazed
specimen was found at Kahûn (P. <i>I.</i> VIII, 42),
its provenance and style pointing to the late
Twelfth Dynasty as the date of this official.
Senb-su-ma is named on several stelae; one, in
the Cairo Mus., gives the name of his father,
Sert-taui (M. <i>Cat. Ab.</i> 784); another, in the
Leyd. Mus. (V. 106) names his wife, “the
Lady Tau-ma;” a third stela, in the Cairo
Mus. (M. <i>Cat. Ab.</i> 904) gives the name of his
son, the <i>ari at abu</i>, Pepa, whose scarab seal is
in the Meux Coll. (Budge, <i>Cat.</i> 455). Senb-su-ma’s
name also occurs on stelae in the B.M.
(252); in the Ermitage Mus., St. Petersburg
(58); and in the Turin Mus. (1303). His
tomb was at Dahshûr, a slab of stone from it
having been found in the cemetery of that
place (M. <i>Mast.</i>, p. 583).</p>
<p class='c026'>9. “The Superintendent of the Seal, Yu-senb.”
v-B. (Fr. <i>Sc.</i> 86.)</p>
<p class='c026'>10. “The Superintendent of the Seal, Amenhetep.”
v-B. (Fr. <i>Sc.</i> 91.) Three other scarabs of
this State Officer are known: one, with continuous
loop-pattern around the name, was
found at Abydos (<i>M.D.</i> 52 f.), and is figured in
Pl. XVI, 3; another is in the Petrie Coll., and
the third is in the v-B. (Fr. <i>Sc.</i> 87.)</p>
<p class='c026'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>11. “The Superintendent of the Seal, Herfu.” L.</p>
<p class='c026'>12. “The Superintendent of the Seal, Erde-ne-Ptah.”
B. 17230. Another specimen is in the Petrie
Coll.</p>
<p class='c026'>13. “The Deputy Superintendent of the Seal, Sehetep-ab-ra.”
C.M. From Abydos. (M. <i>Cat. Ab.</i>
p. 541; <i>cf.</i> <i>M.D.</i>, pl. 48 m.)</p>
<p class='c026'>14. “The Scribe of the Superintendent of the Seal,
Nehesi.” P.</p>
<p class='c026'>15. “The Mayor, Tehuti-nekht.” Amh. This scarab
was bought in Cairo in 1899, and came with
many other antiquities from the tomb of
Tehuti-nekht at El Bersheh. Hence it can be
dated to the reign of Usertsen I, or at latest to
the early years of Amenemhat II (see Griffith
and Newberry, <i>El Bersheh</i> II, p. 13); it is
consequently the oldest <i>absolutely</i> dated scarab
of an official known.</p>
<p class='c026'>16. “The Mayor, Amenemhat-senb-ne-Hather-ab.”
L. Found in Phoenicia.</p>
<p class='c026'>17. “The Mayor, Amenemhat.” L.</p>
<p class='c026'>18. “The Mayor, Auŷ-mes.” B.M. 21906.</p>
<p class='c026'>19. “The Great <i>Uartu</i> of the (Royal) City, Sa-sebek.”
-G. Another scarab of this official, ornamented
with a continuous loop decoration, is in
the v-B. (Fr. <i>Sc.</i> 118.)</p>
<p class='c026'>20. “The <i>Uartu</i> of the Ruler’s Table, Sebekhetep,
son of the <i>Uartu</i> of the Ruler’s Table, Mentuhetep.”
Ashm. Several other scarabs of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>official are known; two specimens are in the
Louvre (P. <i>Sc.</i> 389, 391); another is in the
Turin Mus. (1134; Klaproth, <i>Palin Coll.</i> 1113);
a fourth is in the Cairo Mus. (3795; from
Abydos, M. <i>Cat. Abyd.</i>, p. 541; <i>cf.</i> <i>M.D.</i>
pl. 48 n); and a fifth and well preserved
example is in the Petrie Coll.</p>
<p class='c026'>21. “The Great General Pehui-ef-hu?” Murch.</p>
<p class='c026'>22. “The General, Hora.” Ashm.</p>
<p class='c026'>23. “The Superintendent of the <i>Mentiu</i> (Asiatics),
Ren-senb.” Evans.</p>
<p class='c026'>24. “The Superintendent of the Great Kitchen (?)
Herŷt (?)-si-hetep.” Murch.</p>
<p class='c026'>25. “The King’s Friend, the Superintendent of the
Musicians, Neb-qemiu.” Murch. A stela of
this man, in the Cairo Mus. (M. <i>Cat. Abyd.</i>
813), gives the names of his father, Hora, and
mother, Sefget, and certainly dates from the
period of the Sebekhetep kings.</p>
<p class='c026'>26. “The Surveyor, Nefer-sebek-dedu.” B.M. 28235.</p>
<p class='c026'>27. “The Royal Scribe ... Aka-senb-na.” Murch.</p>
<p class='c026'>28. “The Private Sealer, Sa-hather-aa.” Murch.</p>
<p class='c026'>29. “The Storekeeper, Neb-seshenu.” Murch.</p>
<p class='c026'>30. “The Instructor of the Followers, Deda, son of
the Instructor of the Followers, Beba.” Murch.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>PLATE XII.<br /> <br />SCARABS OF OFFICIALS OF THE<br />  TWELFTH TO FOURTEENTH DYNASTIES—<i>continued</i>.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c025'>1. “The Royal Son, Antefa.” P. From the style of
the cutting and the back of this scarab, I should
be inclined to recognize in this Antefa one of
the princes of the intermediate period between
the Thirteenth and Seventeenth Dynasties,
rather than a prince of the Eleventh Dynasty.</p>
<p class='c026'>2. “The Royal Son Kha-kau.” L. Formerly in the
Palin Coll. (Klaproth, Pl. VI, 295.) Perhaps
this is a scarab of Usertsen III before the Ra
was added to his name (?).</p>
<p class='c026'>3. “The Royal Son, Sa-hather.” C.M. 3796. (M.
<i>Cat. Abd.</i> 539.) Sa-hather was the son of
King Neferhetep.</p>
<p class='c026'>4 and 5. “The Great Royal Wife who is united to
the beauty of the White Crown, Ana.” L. and
v-B. Another specimen is in the Petrie Coll.
The style and cutting of these scarabs would
point to the period of the Sebekhetep kings.</p>
<p class='c026'>6. “The Royal Wife, Sat-sebek.” Davis. A

<h3 class='c019'>1. <span class='sc'>Kirgipa and Her Harîm.</span></h3>
<p class='c006'>Two specimens of this scarab are known, and it
is perhaps the most interesting one of the series. One
example is preserved in the Berl. Mus. (11002), the
other was in the possession of Madame Hoffmann.
An elaborate study of the text of the latter example
has been published by Brugsch in the <i>Ä.Z.</i>, XVIII, 81,
and Maspero has given a drawing of the inscription
(by Legrain, from a paper impression) in his <i>Recueil
des Travaux</i>, XV, 200. The text given in the Plate
is from the Berlin specimen, restored from Maspero’s
published copy.</p>

</div>

<p class='c021'>Scarabs bearing an inscription recording the lion
hunts of Amenhetep III are common, and about forty
specimens are known. Of these, five are in the British
Museum (4095, 12520, 16987, 24169, 29438); four are in
the Louvre (Inv., 787, 788); four in the Berlin Museum
(3481, 3482, 8443, 13274); three in the Leyden Museum
(O. 83-85); and one each in the Cairo (M., <i>Cat. Ab.</i>,
1388), Florence (840), and Bologna (2455) Museums.
In the Cat. des Med., Paris (1021), and in the
Amherst, Edwards, Fraser (<i>Sc.</i> 261), Grant, Hertz
(<i>Cat.</i>, p. 112), Kennard, Myers, Meux (1785), Palin,
Petrie, Posno, H-Price (<i>Cat.</i> 284), and several smaller
collections, are also one each. The example figured
is in the possession of Mr. Nash. The hieroglyphic
text of this scarab has been published, among others,
by Mariette (<i>Alb. de Boulaq</i>, Pl. 36, 532), Maspero
(<i>Histoire</i>, II, p. 315), Brugsch (<i>Ä.Z.</i>, XVIII, 81), and
Budge (<i>Mummy</i>, p. 241), and a translation of it has
been given by Pierret (<i>Cat. Salle Hist.</i>, Louvre, 1877,
p. 138), by Birch (<i>Records of the Past</i>, XII, p. 40),
and many others.</p>

to the seal class, were used as amulets, and a few, like medals,
were cut to commemorate historical events. The amulet class will
be dealt with in another volume; the medal-like series is included

<p class='c045'><span class='label'><a href='#r37'>37</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This title was formerly believed to signify “Treasurer of the
King of Lower Egypt,” but it must be pointed out that <i>byty</i>, in the
royal title, meant “He that belongs to the bee,” or perhaps, “the
Bee-keeper.” Bees were the producers of the chief of primitive
luxuries, and the use of honey and the offering of it instead of wine
ought probably to be considered as a survival from a prehistoric
state of society in which wine was unknown (<i>cf.</i> <i>Journal of Hellenic

<p class='c045'><span class='label'><a href='#r57'>57</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is probable that already at the time of the Eleventh Dynasty
there was a Chief Keeper of the (Royal) Seal, for Mariette found at
Karnak a monument of a certain Khetŷ, who is described as
<i>mer khetem em ta er zer-ef</i>, “Keeper of the (Royal) Seal in the
whole land.” Mariette, <i>Karnak</i>, pl. 8 j.) Of this Khetŷ there is a
statuette in the Leyden Museum, and he is certainly the same
individual as we see represented behind King Antef on one of the
rocks of the Shût er Rigal. Under the New Empire we find
mentioned once a

Keeper of the Seal of the Great Green Sea,” <i>i.e.</i>, of the

Nefer-hetep at Aswan (De Morgan, <i>Cat.</i>, I, p. 17); the inscriptions
of Rekhmara (Newberry, <i>Rekhmara</i>, Pl. III, l. 5, etc.); the scene
on a slab from the tomb of a High Priest of Memphis, where the
Chancellor is represented standing immediately behind the Vezîrs;
and from the very powerful position of the Chancellor Baŷ under
Ta-usert and Sa-ptah. The position of the Chancellors during the

<div class='footnote c044' id='f129'>
<p class='c045'><span class='label'><a href='#r129'>129</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This is probably the same place-name as the Kerŷ mentioned
in the tomb of Hûŷ at Thebes as the southern boundary of Kush
(Ethiopia) at the time of King Tût-ankh-amen (see <a href='#pl-II'>Pl. II</a>). It
was almost certainly the modern Gebel Barkal.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c044' id='f130'>
<p class='c045'><span class='label'><a href='#r130'>130</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The position of the “district of Shetau or (Shetep)” is
uncertain. The inscription merely says that the king went down
stream, and that the journey took him a night to accomplish, but
the name of the place from whence Amenhetep and his officers
started is not recorded. Mr. Fraser (<i>P.S.B.A.</i>, XXI, p. 157) suggests
Memphis as the starting place, and the Wadŷ Tumilât as the scene
of the hunt, and he further remarks that “except the Fayûm,
there is no place that I can think of in Upper Egypt where one can
imagine there were ever wild cattle.” I suspect, however, that it was
from Thebes that the royal hunter set out, and that the district of
Shetau (or Shetep) was one of those wadŷs near Keneh (just a
night’s journey from Thebes down stream) which at certain times
of the year contain low, but luxuriant vegetation. I have visited
this district several times (in February 1896, again in December
1901, and for a third time in March 1904), and was much struck
by the great quantity of vegetation which is to be seen in the
desert to the east of Kuft and Keneh. There is one wadŷ in
particular which extends for some miles in a northerly direction
between Legêta and Keneh that literally abounds in low shrubs
and other vegetation, far more than enough to support vast herds
of wild cattle. It may here be pointed out that the ancient fauna
of Egypt differed very greatly from its present fauna. Before the
advent of the camel into Egypt, all the wadŷs of the Arabian
chain of hills were plentifully stocked with game of all kinds. At
Beni Hasan, El Bersheh, and many other places are represented
scenes of hunting wild animals, including the lion, bubalis, etc.;
and the wadŷs east of Keneh were celebrated as hunting grounds
at the time of Thothmes III and Amenhetep II. In more than
one private tomb at Thebes we have scenes of hunting which are
expressly stated to have taken place “in the <i>Ant</i>,” <i>i.e.</i>, the desert
to the east of Kuft, and in the tomb of Men-kheper-ra-senb the
superintendent of the hunting at Kuft is mentioned.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote c044' id='f132'>
<p class='c045'><span class='label'><a href='#r132'>132</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Driving the animals into nets was a favourite method of
hunting in ancient times (<i>cf.</i>, among many other instances, my
<i>El Bersheh</i>, I, pl. VII, and the Vaphio Vase at Athens). Nets are
still used for this purpose in some parts of Africa (Baker’s

<div class='footnote c044' id='f133'>
<p class='c045'><span class='label'><a href='#r133'>133</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Dr. Budge has suggested to me that this dyke may have
been a series of covered pits into which the animals would fall,
thus enabling the huntsmen to capture them easily. He would
also identify the <i>semau</i> of the Egyptians with the <i>rimi</i> of the
Assyrian inscriptions, an animal hunted by Tiglath Pileser and
other monarchs.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c044' id='f134'>
<p class='c045'><span class='label'><a href='#r134'>134</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Since this was written, a study of the inscription on this
scarab has been published by Steindorff, from my copy of the
Alnwick specimen, in <i>Ä.Z.</i>, XXXIX, 62.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c044' id='f135'>
<p class='c045'><span class='label'><a href='#r135'>135</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Vatican specimen gives <i>kher hen ne Heru</i> for the abbreviated
<i>kher Heru</i> on the Alnwick example.</p>

<div class='footnote c044' id='f136'>
<p class='c045'><span class='label'><a href='#r136'>136</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Vatican scarab gives the determinative of land (the
triangle) in the place of the <i>t</i> on the Alnwick specimen.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c044' id='f137'>
<p class='c045'><span class='label'><a href='#r137'>137</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A mis-reading (Zaru) of this place-name has led to the identification
of the city with Zaru or Zal (perhaps the modern Sele), the
eastern frontier fort of Egypt. Prof. Breasted, Prof. Steindorff, and
the writer, however, all came independently to the conclusion that
Zarukha must be the name of the palace-town of Amenophis III
and Thŷi, which is situated a little to the south of Medinet Habu;
the lake mentioned on this scarab is therefore to be identified with
the modern Birket Habu.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote c044' id='f138'>
<p class='c045'><span class='label'><a href='#r138'>138</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The numerals given on the Vatican scarab are blundered, and
consequently difficult to read.</p>

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
